1
00:01:33,373 --> 00:01:35,310
No, I shouldn't interrupt him.

2
00:01:35,472 --> 00:01:36,665
He'll call me.

3
00:01:55,923 --> 00:01:57,973
Director Gold. Did you meet her?

4
00:01:59,132 --> 00:02:00,286
Are you all right?

5
00:02:00,492 --> 00:02:03,562
I told you to sleep. It's late. Why aren't you asleep?

6
00:02:04,933 --> 00:02:06,801
I usually go to bed very late.

7
00:02:06,802 --> 00:02:08,231
My nickname is "night owl".

8
00:02:08,573 --> 00:02:10,542
I thought we promised not to lie to each other.

9
00:02:11,342 --> 00:02:12,536
Are you telling the truth?

10
00:02:12,973 --> 00:02:14,339
Of course, I am.

11
00:02:14,983 --> 00:02:17,869
I called in case you were waiting. Go to bed now.

12
00:02:21,953 --> 00:02:23,074
Director Gold?

13
00:02:29,723 --> 00:02:32,181
Are you okay? Where are you right now?

14
00:02:32,533 --> 00:02:33,655
It's late.

15
00:02:34,763 --> 00:02:36,028
I shouldn't have called.

16
00:02:36,633 --> 00:02:37,795
Good night.

17
00:02:37,832 --> 00:02:39,943
Director Gold. Director Gold?

18
00:04:16,932 --> 00:04:18,095
Deok Mi.

19
00:04:19,473 --> 00:04:22,053
You thought I wouldn't be worried if you hung up like that?

20
00:04:22,543 --> 00:04:24,941
If you want to cry, do it in front of me, so I can comfort you.

21
00:04:24,942 --> 00:04:26,881
What are you doing here alone?

22
00:04:27,372 --> 00:04:29,789
You're making me so upset. I hate you.

23
00:04:36,452 --> 00:04:38,359
Don't smile with that face that's about to cry.

24
00:04:38,552 --> 00:04:39,879
I want to cry.

25
00:04:40,552 --> 00:04:41,991
Because you're hitting me so hard.

26
00:05:03,382 --> 00:05:04,944
Director Gold, are you asleep?

27
00:05:06,083 --> 00:05:07,204
Yes.

28
00:05:08,853 --> 00:05:09,974
Shall we go home?

29
00:05:14,052 --> 00:05:16,163
I don't think I'll be able to sleep if I go home.

30
00:05:16,723 --> 00:05:17,885
It feels so strange.

31
00:05:18,362 --> 00:05:19,485
What does?

32
00:05:20,262 --> 00:05:23,628
The person who I've wondered about my entire life...

33
00:05:25,973 --> 00:05:28,727
is sleeping downstairs right now.

34
00:05:30,072 --> 00:05:31,297
It feels strange.

35
00:05:31,973 --> 00:05:33,339
Then come over to my house.

36
00:05:37,413 --> 00:05:40,819
But how did you know I was here?

37
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,546
You didn't know?

38
00:05:43,023 --> 00:05:45,368
I implanted a GPS device inside your body.

39
00:05:51,163 --> 00:05:52,826
Did I tell you about my parents?

40
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:57,158
The parents who adopted me?

41
00:05:58,103 --> 00:05:59,224
No, right?

42
00:06:00,973 --> 00:06:02,503
They were nice people.

43
00:06:04,612 --> 00:06:08,928
They adopted a seven-year-old kid and raised him happily.

44
00:06:10,312 --> 00:06:12,628
My parents once told me this.

45
00:06:13,182 --> 00:06:15,978
"Your mother gave birth to you and raised you..."

46
00:06:17,182 --> 00:06:18,651
"because she loved you."

47
00:06:20,423 --> 00:06:23,789
"She had no choice but to let us raise you."

48
00:06:24,862 --> 00:06:28,197
"So you have not been abandoned."

49
00:06:29,502 --> 00:06:32,633
"You're being protected." That's what they said.

50
00:06:35,942 --> 00:06:37,708
But the person I met today...

51
00:06:41,242 --> 00:06:42,610
said she was sorry to me.

52
00:06:44,213 --> 00:06:47,823
So it doesn't feel like I've been protected.

53
00:06:50,023 --> 00:06:51,991
It's like I've been abandoned again.

54
00:06:57,622 --> 00:06:58,684
She probably...

55
00:07:00,733 --> 00:07:03,047
wanted to say those words all her life.

56
00:07:07,233 --> 00:07:08,630
She loved you so much,

57
00:07:09,403 --> 00:07:11,554
and she was sorry she couldn't be with you.

58
00:07:15,483 --> 00:07:16,605
Do you think so?

59
00:07:22,783 --> 00:07:24,109
You should get some sleep.

60
00:07:24,552 --> 00:07:26,766
You'll feel better when you wake up.

61
00:07:42,372 --> 00:07:47,310
(Episode 14: A Star That Shines My Dark Heart)

62
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:34,562
Secretary Kim, is Hyo Jin actually riding the bus right now?

63
00:08:35,222 --> 00:08:38,394
Yes, she must've learned how to charge her BC.

64
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:40,685
"BC"?

65
00:08:41,403 --> 00:08:42,801
What's that?

66
00:08:42,802 --> 00:08:45,455
It means she learned how to charge her bus card.

67
00:08:47,102 --> 00:08:50,306
I thought she'd call me crying to take her back.

68
00:08:51,043 --> 00:08:52,910
But she learned how to charge her bus card?

69
00:08:53,572 --> 00:08:54,766
What do you think?

70
00:08:55,383 --> 00:08:57,351
Tell me. What do you think?

71
00:08:59,852 --> 00:09:02,984
The next stop is Jindan...

72
00:09:04,322 --> 00:09:05,750
Oh, my gosh.

73
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,326
Did you sleep well?

74
00:09:23,072 --> 00:09:24,327
What about you?

75
00:09:27,373 --> 00:09:29,148
Director Gold. Ms. Sung.

76
00:09:32,182 --> 00:09:33,508
- Hello. - Hello.

77
00:09:34,513 --> 00:09:37,681
Wouldn't you call this an act of privatizing the art gallery?

78
00:09:37,682 --> 00:09:40,447
You all came to work early.

79
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:42,356
- We came on time... - Yes, we're early.

80
00:09:43,023 --> 00:09:45,231
I don't think we need to change the sofa.

81
00:09:45,232 --> 00:09:46,794
It's still very cushiony.

82
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:54,815
- What is wrong with you? - Why would you do that?

83
00:09:55,302 --> 00:09:57,342
Here. Eat this.

84
00:09:58,673 --> 00:10:00,412
We have to see that kind of stuff as we work,

85
00:10:00,413 --> 00:10:01,943
so the least we can do is keep ourselves full.

86
00:10:06,153 --> 00:10:07,642
You're right.

87
00:10:09,322 --> 00:10:11,567
Two iced Americanos.

88
00:10:12,623 --> 00:10:14,938
- Can I get a straw? - Oh, sure. A straw.

89
00:10:16,692 --> 00:10:18,862
- Here you go. Enjoy. - How much is this?

90
00:10:18,863 --> 00:10:20,016
It's 80 cents.

91
00:10:20,163 --> 00:10:21,862
- Let me take your order. - Two iced lattes, please.

92
00:10:21,863 --> 00:10:23,331
Two iced lattes.

93
00:10:23,633 --> 00:10:25,366
I'll take your card. Would you like the receipt?

94
00:10:25,373 --> 00:10:26,453
- No, it's okay. - Okay.

95
00:10:27,033 --> 00:10:29,245
So you're telling me that Seon Joo helped you fix your guitar?

96
00:10:29,873 --> 00:10:31,678
- Yes. - And she went to your show?

97
00:10:32,342 --> 00:10:34,454
- Yes. - And she even made a fan club?

98
00:10:36,043 --> 00:10:37,063
Yes.

99
00:10:39,913 --> 00:10:41,891
- So you think Seon Joo likes... - Hey.

100
00:10:42,482 --> 00:10:43,573
Seung Min.

101
00:10:45,123 --> 00:10:47,321
- What are you asking him? - I was just...

102
00:10:47,322 --> 00:10:49,710
Never mind. What did he ask you?

103
00:10:49,822 --> 00:10:52,342
He wanted to know if you like me.

104
00:10:54,562 --> 00:10:55,902
You're even doubting me now?

105
00:10:55,903 --> 00:10:57,561
- No, that's not it. - Ms. Lee.

106
00:10:57,562 --> 00:10:59,715
Isn't it true that you like me?

107
00:11:01,102 --> 00:11:03,184
What I like is music.

108
00:11:03,503 --> 00:11:04,742
I like your music.

109
00:11:04,743 --> 00:11:06,681
I told you, didn't I? She likes me.

110
00:11:07,712 --> 00:11:08,834
I guess you're right.

111
00:11:09,283 --> 00:11:11,180
What are you talking about?

112
00:11:11,982 --> 00:11:14,879
Seung Min, are you...

113
00:11:18,222 --> 00:11:20,221
(Producer Yoo Joong Hyeok)

114
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:22,406
- What's this? - My friend's a music producer.

115
00:11:22,863 --> 00:11:24,973
And he's looking for a guy who's in a band.

116
00:11:27,263 --> 00:11:28,691
So I thought about introducing Joo Hyuk to him.

117
00:11:29,432 --> 00:11:30,483
Really?

118
00:11:33,932 --> 00:11:35,198
Why would you do that?

119
00:11:35,202 --> 00:11:36,732
Because you like him.

120
00:11:39,113 --> 00:11:40,133
As a fan.

121
00:11:40,513 --> 00:11:44,419
So I figured you'd get to smile more if Joo Hyuk becomes successful.

122
00:11:47,352 --> 00:11:48,444
Seon Joo.

123
00:11:49,952 --> 00:11:51,074
I feel...

124
00:11:52,623 --> 00:11:54,733
the happiest when you smile.

125
00:11:56,222 --> 00:11:58,028
But I had forgotten that.

126
00:12:01,633 --> 00:12:02,928
From now on,

127
00:12:03,763 --> 00:12:06,251
I'm going to focus on making you smile.

128
00:12:07,033 --> 00:12:09,828
I don't care about variety shows or getting promoted.

129
00:12:10,403 --> 00:12:11,595
I just want to make you smile.

130
00:12:11,873 --> 00:12:13,473
That's all I'm going to focus on from now on.

131
00:12:14,113 --> 00:12:15,981
- So... - But Ms. Lee told me...

132
00:12:15,982 --> 00:12:18,298
that she doesn't want me to become too famous.

133
00:12:18,383 --> 00:12:20,046
She wants to keep me hidden to herself.

134
00:12:21,013 --> 00:12:23,165
- Should I leave you guys alone? - You should've done that earlier.

135
00:12:30,263 --> 00:12:31,558
Seon Joo.

136
00:12:32,133 --> 00:12:33,968
- Seung Min. - Yes?

137
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,267
I'm not forgiving you.

138
00:12:38,033 --> 00:12:39,766
I'm just giving you a second chance.

139
00:12:41,503 --> 00:12:43,848
Okay, that's all I need.

140
00:12:47,043 --> 00:12:49,441
- Honey. - Let me go.

141
00:12:49,442 --> 00:12:51,320
I said I'm only giving you a second chance.

142
00:12:53,913 --> 00:12:55,105
Thank you.

143
00:13:11,462 --> 00:13:13,544
(Cha Shi An)

144
00:13:21,442 --> 00:13:22,462
Hello?

145
00:13:52,743 --> 00:13:53,794
At first,

146
00:13:53,972 --> 00:13:56,226
I thought you approached me because you heard some kind of a rumor.

147
00:13:56,613 --> 00:13:59,673
I also got suspicious thinking that you were after a scandal.

148
00:14:01,722 --> 00:14:03,517
But I was strangely drawn to you.

149
00:14:03,852 --> 00:14:06,984
The more I got to know you, I felt very comfortable around you,

150
00:14:07,192 --> 00:14:08,589
and I wanted to become close to you.

151
00:14:10,763 --> 00:14:14,364
We both liked Lee Sol's paintings, and you also lived right above me.

152
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,889
All of that felt like fate.

153
00:14:18,432 --> 00:14:19,800
But eventually,

154
00:14:21,003 --> 00:14:22,533
I guess I was right all along,

155
00:14:24,302 --> 00:14:25,435
Ryan.

156
00:14:32,153 --> 00:14:33,306
Mr. Cha.

157
00:14:33,712 --> 00:14:36,436
I'll send you my mom's number.

158
00:14:37,322 --> 00:14:38,852
Give her a chance to explain.

159
00:14:39,423 --> 00:14:43,675
It might be an apology or an excuse, but give her a chance to explain.

160
00:14:45,393 --> 00:14:46,585
Just this once.

161
00:15:00,572 --> 00:15:02,211
Ms. Sung, we need to give...

162
00:15:02,212 --> 00:15:04,211
the final confirmation regarding the catalog design by next week...

163
00:15:04,212 --> 00:15:05,885
if we want it printed according to schedule.

164
00:15:06,153 --> 00:15:08,396
How should we introduce Lee Sol's paintings?

165
00:15:08,452 --> 00:15:10,351
Have you gotten any calls?

166
00:15:10,352 --> 00:15:13,381
I asked everyone I know, but I couldn't get anything.

167
00:15:14,793 --> 00:15:16,048
When do we need to confirm it by?

168
00:15:16,092 --> 00:15:17,521
Next Wednesday.

169
00:15:18,663 --> 00:15:20,530
Then let's look a little more.

170
00:15:20,763 --> 00:15:23,690
Okay, I also can't wait to see the final piece.

171
00:15:24,863 --> 00:15:26,056
Okay.

172
00:15:30,342 --> 00:15:32,658
(If anyone knows or owns a similar painting, please contact me.)

173
00:15:52,633 --> 00:15:55,763
Hello? Hi, this is Sung Deok Mi from Cheum Art Gallery.

174
00:15:56,503 --> 00:15:58,441
Right. Thanks for your email.

175
00:15:59,273 --> 00:16:01,701
We're interested in Lee Sol's soap bubble series...

176
00:16:01,702 --> 00:16:03,814
that were sold in the previous auction.

177
00:16:04,903 --> 00:16:06,443
Oh, from the seller?

178
00:16:07,873 --> 00:16:09,954
Yes, two more pieces from the series.

179
00:16:11,182 --> 00:16:14,282
So they're going to place the first sale at the next auction?

180
00:16:14,283 --> 00:16:16,393
- Two pieces? - How many is that in total?

181
00:16:16,582 --> 00:16:18,821
- Eight. - Actually, I was hoping maybe...

182
00:16:18,822 --> 00:16:22,157
you could first sell them to us in private.

183
00:16:22,493 --> 00:16:25,930
Of course, we will pay extra to show our appreciation.

184
00:16:26,293 --> 00:16:28,505
Yes, sure. Please let us know.

185
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,861
Thank you very much. Bye.

186
00:16:34,873 --> 00:16:36,127
How did it go?

187
00:16:37,072 --> 00:16:40,372
The collector who sold the painting last time found two additional ones.

188
00:16:40,373 --> 00:16:42,841
They're going to sell them to us, and they told me that they'll call.

189
00:16:42,842 --> 00:16:44,742
Gosh, that's great!

190
00:16:44,743 --> 00:16:46,314
That means we only need to find one more, right?

191
00:16:46,712 --> 00:16:47,937
Nice!

192
00:16:48,623 --> 00:16:49,979
They're going to send us an image file of the paintings.

193
00:16:50,222 --> 00:16:52,231
- Okay, okay. - We did it.

194
00:17:30,163 --> 00:17:31,387
Knock, knock.

195
00:17:34,232 --> 00:17:36,272
What's the "knock, knock" for when you're already inside?

196
00:17:36,563 --> 00:17:38,093
I have good news for you.

197
00:17:38,262 --> 00:17:40,374
We found two more of Lee Sol's paintings.

198
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:42,795
Okay.

199
00:17:44,502 --> 00:17:47,124
Director Gold, you know what a picture puzzle is, right?

200
00:17:47,373 --> 00:17:48,810
- Do you want to try that? - What?

201
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:50,664
Come here.

202
00:17:56,553 --> 00:18:00,633
You know how sometimes there are hidden messages in movies?

203
00:18:00,923 --> 00:18:03,003
These paintings also have hidden messages.

204
00:18:03,063 --> 00:18:04,348
Why don't you try to find them?

205
00:18:47,403 --> 00:18:48,565
Did you find them?

206
00:18:50,542 --> 00:18:51,665
These...

207
00:18:52,873 --> 00:18:54,612
Soap bubbles, a rocking horse,

208
00:18:54,613 --> 00:18:56,418
a Ferris wheel, and the Viking ship ride.

209
00:18:56,682 --> 00:18:59,468
They're the things that children especially enjoy.

210
00:19:01,012 --> 00:19:03,052
I think I know what the artist was thinking...

211
00:19:03,053 --> 00:19:05,368
when she drew these paintings.

212
00:19:07,222 --> 00:19:08,721
You do too, right?

213
00:19:13,393 --> 00:19:15,431
How about you call it an early day?

214
00:19:15,432 --> 00:19:17,198
I'm sure there's someone you should meet.

215
00:19:22,742 --> 00:19:24,986
She'll most certainly be waiting for you.

216
00:19:52,633 --> 00:19:54,570
It's Cheum Gallery, right?

217
00:20:05,752 --> 00:20:06,834
Hello?

218
00:20:09,653 --> 00:20:10,743
Hello?

219
00:20:12,452 --> 00:20:14,942
This is Ryan Gold.

220
00:20:16,962 --> 00:20:18,085
I see.

221
00:20:18,692 --> 00:20:20,293
I'd like to talk.

222
00:20:21,163 --> 00:20:22,866
Could you spare me some time?

223
00:20:38,853 --> 00:20:40,342
Would you like something to drink?

224
00:20:42,883 --> 00:20:44,454
I don't have any coffee though.

225
00:20:46,823 --> 00:20:49,780
Tea is fine. I can't drink coffee anyway.

226
00:20:55,732 --> 00:20:57,875
Thank you for reaching out to me first.

227
00:21:02,202 --> 00:21:03,528
I missed you.

228
00:21:05,873 --> 00:21:07,709
I know that...

229
00:21:08,073 --> 00:21:10,694
I don't have any right to say that.

230
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:15,434
However, if I must be shameless to see you,

231
00:21:16,182 --> 00:21:17,580
then that's what I'll be.

232
00:21:22,022 --> 00:21:23,594
I missed you, Yoon Jae.

233
00:21:29,303 --> 00:21:32,638
I don't have any memories.

234
00:21:34,073 --> 00:21:38,019
All I remember about you is how you look from behind.

235
00:21:39,012 --> 00:21:40,849
You're either painting...

236
00:21:43,282 --> 00:21:45,150
or leaving me behind.

237
00:21:52,623 --> 00:21:53,847
Why did you abandon me?

238
00:21:56,423 --> 00:21:57,586
I'm sorry.

239
00:22:00,393 --> 00:22:01,820
Why did you leave me?

240
00:22:03,462 --> 00:22:04,727
I didn't.

241
00:22:06,232 --> 00:22:09,436
I only thought I'd be gone for a while.

242
00:22:10,942 --> 00:22:12,747
I was going to return to you soon.

243
00:22:14,212 --> 00:22:16,692
I didn't expect it to take 26 years.

244
00:22:21,053 --> 00:22:22,205
That day...

245
00:22:25,323 --> 00:22:27,873
I shouldn't have gone there that day.

246
00:22:29,663 --> 00:22:33,303
I was barely getting by when I was suddenly offered a contribution.

247
00:22:34,232 --> 00:22:35,762
With the money,

248
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:39,555
I thought about cooking you a delicious meal...

249
00:22:40,272 --> 00:22:44,251
and taking you to the amusement park you always wanted to go to.

250
00:22:45,002 --> 00:22:46,746
That's why we went out that day.

251
00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:54,552
Yoon Jae, can you play by yourself for a moment?

252
00:22:54,553 --> 00:22:56,052
I won't be long.

253
00:22:56,053 --> 00:22:57,755
Where are you going?

254
00:23:00,053 --> 00:23:03,221
Someone offered to help me with my paintings,

255
00:23:03,222 --> 00:23:04,590
so I'm going to meet him.

256
00:23:04,893 --> 00:23:06,627
He's quite scary though.

257
00:23:06,932 --> 00:23:08,116
Do you still want to join me?

258
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:12,035
Have fun in the playground.

259
00:23:12,133 --> 00:23:14,856
I'll be back before you know it.

260
00:23:15,873 --> 00:23:17,971
You'll be back soon, right?

261
00:23:17,972 --> 00:23:19,502
Of course, I will.

262
00:23:25,813 --> 00:23:29,596
I had no idea that it'd be the last time...

263
00:23:30,952 --> 00:23:32,757
we see each other.

264
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,029
On my way back to you,

265
00:23:38,663 --> 00:23:40,366
I got in an accident.

266
00:23:41,762 --> 00:23:44,047
My gosh. Miss?

267
00:23:44,403 --> 00:23:45,555
Are you all right?

268
00:23:45,873 --> 00:23:48,219
I suffered a major injury.

269
00:23:50,373 --> 00:23:52,035
My Yoon Jae...

270
00:23:54,873 --> 00:23:58,044
Then because of that accident...

271
00:24:00,782 --> 00:24:03,271
That accident took everything from me.

272
00:24:04,522 --> 00:24:06,256
I lost my precious boy.

273
00:24:08,252 --> 00:24:09,446
Is this the truth?

274
00:24:13,163 --> 00:24:15,069
Then the orphanage...

275
00:24:15,732 --> 00:24:17,436
I didn't abandon you.

276
00:24:17,962 --> 00:24:19,636
I know this might sound like an excuse,

277
00:24:22,573 --> 00:24:24,174
but when I came to,

278
00:24:26,143 --> 00:24:28,559
a long time had passed.

279
00:24:30,313 --> 00:24:33,576
I searched for you everywhere like a crazy woman...

280
00:24:34,053 --> 00:24:37,081
and asked around for any news of you but couldn't find you.

281
00:24:37,883 --> 00:24:40,269
I never abandoned you, Yoon Jae.

282
00:24:40,923 --> 00:24:42,626
I never wanted to leave you.

283
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:46,954
I'm sorry.

284
00:24:48,192 --> 00:24:50,579
Leaving you all alone in an unfamiliar place,

285
00:24:52,063 --> 00:24:53,561
my accident,

286
00:24:54,173 --> 00:24:56,549
and not being able to find you...

287
00:24:58,303 --> 00:24:59,771
I apologize for it all.

288
00:25:04,883 --> 00:25:06,178
After I had lost you,

289
00:25:07,512 --> 00:25:09,562
I lived my whole life in regret.

290
00:25:11,252 --> 00:25:12,446
My whole life.

291
00:25:18,792 --> 00:25:21,036
This might all seem like just an excuse to you,

292
00:25:23,932 --> 00:25:25,493
and you can still hate me...

293
00:25:25,972 --> 00:25:27,360
and resent me all you want.

294
00:25:28,502 --> 00:25:29,767
Just like this,

295
00:25:30,442 --> 00:25:33,738
I only ask for your permission to let me see you from afar.

296
00:25:37,143 --> 00:25:38,264
Yoon Jae.

297
00:25:42,553 --> 00:25:43,745
I...

298
00:25:47,093 --> 00:25:49,540
have somewhere to be. I'm sorry.

299
00:26:37,403 --> 00:26:38,973
Why did you come back?

300
00:26:49,722 --> 00:26:51,416
Can I stay like this for a while?

301
00:26:53,823 --> 00:26:55,078
Did you see her?

302
00:26:57,593 --> 00:27:01,029
Can I ask what you two talked about?

303
00:27:02,093 --> 00:27:03,429
Words I want to believe...

304
00:27:07,803 --> 00:27:09,475
that can't possibly be true.

305
00:27:11,573 --> 00:27:15,346
She didn't abandon me. Apparently, she lost me.

306
00:27:18,982 --> 00:27:20,105
Then what about...

307
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:23,061
your memories at the orphanage?

308
00:27:24,022 --> 00:27:26,776
I have no idea. The version I know is completely different.

309
00:27:28,823 --> 00:27:30,088
I couldn't resent her...

310
00:27:32,163 --> 00:27:33,559
nor understand her.

311
00:27:35,093 --> 00:27:39,387
You were a little boy back then, so your memory could be wrong.

312
00:27:40,932 --> 00:27:44,543
Instead of focusing on memories, let's feel her sincerity.

313
00:27:49,242 --> 00:27:50,610
I'd like to do that too.

314
00:28:08,593 --> 00:28:10,704
You're my friend whom I spent my entire life with.

315
00:28:11,563 --> 00:28:13,368
It was nice to see you again.

316
00:28:35,153 --> 00:28:37,508
Pictures don't lie.

317
00:28:40,863 --> 00:28:42,321
(Jerk Eun Gi)

318
00:28:47,873 --> 00:28:49,882
(Jerk Eun Gi)

319
00:28:54,073 --> 00:28:55,164
Hey.

320
00:28:55,782 --> 00:28:57,985
Deok Mi, come out for a second.

321
00:28:58,442 --> 00:28:59,533
What?

322
00:28:59,782 --> 00:29:03,087
I'm in front of your house. It'll just take a second.

323
00:29:04,153 --> 00:29:05,274
Why is he here?

324
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:14,164
You might faint and die if you run hard like that at night.

325
00:29:15,151 --> 00:29:16,792
There's something I really wanted to say.

326
00:29:17,361 --> 00:29:18,442
What is it?

327
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:21,283
Happy birthday. It's your birthday soon.

328
00:29:22,331 --> 00:29:23,758
But why are you empty-handed?

329
00:29:24,401 --> 00:29:25,931
I have a birthday gift too.

330
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:31,015
- Me. - You're so lame.

331
00:29:32,341 --> 00:29:34,482
I've just returned as your friend.

332
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:38,003
Nam Eun Gi, who has been your best friend for 33 years.

333
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,668
I'm really embarrassed to say this,

334
00:29:46,051 --> 00:29:47,315
but do you remember...

335
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:49,500
when I ran away from home because I didn't want to be an athlete?

336
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:53,454
Do you remember grabbing me by my hair and dragging me home?

337
00:29:53,891 --> 00:29:57,400
I can't believe you still remember that.

338
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:01,557
I said you were nothing to me that time,

339
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,435
and you beat me up so much.

340
00:30:04,341 --> 00:30:06,482
You told me not to say that to family.

341
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,435
Of course.

342
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:13,569
It hurt so much that I wanted to cry, but I couldn't help but smile.

343
00:30:16,351 --> 00:30:19,717
When you said I was your family.

344
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,229
I felt so grateful.

345
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,333
I felt that I should...

346
00:30:34,171 --> 00:30:38,015
stay like that with you without changing for a long time.

347
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,465
But...

348
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:48,711
I started to like you.

349
00:30:52,081 --> 00:30:53,376
That's the truth.

350
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,979
But I realized something while we spent time apart.

351
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:03,985
I just...

352
00:31:05,831 --> 00:31:07,198
like it when you smile.

353
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,754
Even if I'm not the person beside you.

354
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,014
Even if you're a fangirl, or there's another man beside you.

355
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,639
As long as you're happy, and you're smiling,

356
00:31:24,081 --> 00:31:25,856
that's what makes me happiest.

357
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,505
You can call that a family, right?

358
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:43,347
My friend, who is so brave and has a really beautiful smile,

359
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,561
Sung Deok Mi.

360
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,950
I'm sorry for making you feel uncomfortable all this time.

361
00:31:50,341 --> 00:31:51,564
I'm really sorry.

362
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:00,134
Will you accept me as your friend now?

363
00:32:04,121 --> 00:32:05,182
Eun Gi.

364
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:08,425
Thank you for saying that.

365
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,295
And thank you for coming back.

366
00:32:17,571 --> 00:32:19,448
You still have to give me a birthday gift.

367
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:22,779
I brought you one. Me.

368
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:25,217
What would I use you for?

369
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,580
A tiger is stronger than a lion.

370
00:32:27,581 --> 00:32:29,050
Are you mad? I'll bring the Lion here.

371
00:32:29,051 --> 00:32:30,150
- Bring him. - Are you sure?

372
00:32:30,151 --> 00:32:32,292
- I'll shoulder throw him. - Don't be ridiculous.

373
00:32:45,131 --> 00:32:47,578
What do you think? Looking at a man working from behind.

374
00:32:47,871 --> 00:32:48,922
Do I look cool?

375
00:32:49,671 --> 00:32:51,130
You look very cool.

376
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,644
Shi An, I have...

377
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:01,487
a lot to tell you.

378
00:33:01,851 --> 00:33:04,777
By any chance, did Ryan call you?

379
00:33:09,151 --> 00:33:11,405
How do you think he knew your number?

380
00:33:12,261 --> 00:33:13,556
I know.

381
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:17,656
I've always known for a long time.

382
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:21,571
That you had a very painful past...

383
00:33:22,131 --> 00:33:23,976
and that I have an older brother.

384
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,414
But why didn't you tell me?

385
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:33,154
Since it was such a hurtful memory to you.

386
00:33:34,611 --> 00:33:35,732
So I waited.

387
00:33:36,951 --> 00:33:39,673
Until I grew old enough for you to tell me...

388
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,947
and rely on me.

389
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:47,137
I thought you were still a baby.

390
00:33:49,801 --> 00:33:51,290
Thank you, Shi An.

391
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,567
Did it go well with Ryan?

392
00:34:02,471 --> 00:34:03,868
I guess it didn't go well.

393
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,295
I did something unforgivable.

394
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:13,844
Mom.

395
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:17,464
- Yes. - Let's show him...

396
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,846
all of your paintings.

397
00:34:20,031 --> 00:34:22,101
That doesn't sound like a good idea.

398
00:34:22,631 --> 00:34:23,752
Why?

399
00:34:24,201 --> 00:34:26,271
All of this happened...

400
00:34:27,571 --> 00:34:29,162
because of those paintings.

401
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,134
It's so cruel.

402
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,938
Ryan is the person who must see those paintings more than anyone.

403
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:42,105
He must see them.

404
00:34:43,821 --> 00:34:45,656
For his own sake as well.

405
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,670
Mom, wait here for a second.

406
00:34:57,644 --> 00:35:02,644


407
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:11,535
Yes, Mr. Cha. I was just about to call you.

408
00:35:11,841 --> 00:35:14,432
We found two more of Lee Sol's paintings.

409
00:35:14,451 --> 00:35:16,050
We expressed our interest in purchasing them.

410
00:35:16,051 --> 00:35:17,754
I'll call you again once we receive an answer.

411
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:21,217
Okay. Then is there just one piece left now?

412
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:23,490
Yes. We're trying our best to find it, so...

413
00:35:23,491 --> 00:35:24,786
There's no need.

414
00:35:25,321 --> 00:35:28,085
- Why? - I know who has...

415
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,352
the last painting.

416
00:35:30,201 --> 00:35:33,261
I really hope Ryan will see that last piece.

417
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:36,880
Can you persuade him?

418
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,439
At this late hour?

419
00:36:06,901 --> 00:36:08,909
And she's even walking...

420
00:36:09,531 --> 00:36:11,887
such a far distance? My daughter Hyo Jin?

421
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:16,605
Mr. Kim, check how safe this neighborhood is.

422
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:19,706
Mom!

423
00:36:22,611 --> 00:36:24,457
Mom, did you go grocery shopping?

424
00:36:24,681 --> 00:36:27,067
Just some ingredients for japchae and some squid.

425
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,748
Do you like squid soup?

426
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:31,411
Yes. I love everything that you cook.

427
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,480
Let's go.

428
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,459
- Mr. Kim? - Yes, Ms. Eom.

429
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:40,153
Did you just hear Hyo Jin call her "mom"?

430
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:41,451
Yes.

431
00:36:41,701 --> 00:36:42,996
What do you think?

432
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:45,970
Why are they walking arm in arm? Tell me what you think!

433
00:36:45,971 --> 00:36:48,409
I think she has stolen your daughter from you.

434
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:49,563
Oh my gosh!

435
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:02,074
Yes, Deok Mi.

436
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:04,873
Director Gold, I'll send you an address, so head over here.

437
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,710
- What? - I received a sudden call.

438
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,756
The owner of Lee Sol's painting wants to show it to us.

439
00:37:11,201 --> 00:37:12,894
It's the last remaining piece.

440
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,937
Hurry up, I'll be waiting.

441
00:37:36,221 --> 00:37:37,516
This is where the painting is?

442
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:41,289
Yes, the owner kept it in the cathedral.

443
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:42,993
So we agreed to meet here.

444
00:37:54,671 --> 00:37:55,792
You're here.

445
00:37:59,181 --> 00:38:00,333
Deok Mi.

446
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:03,228
- To be honest... - She did nothing wrong.

447
00:38:04,151 --> 00:38:06,538
I'm the one who asked her to bring you here.

448
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:12,105
My mom also didn't know...

449
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:14,454
that you were coming.

450
00:38:18,631 --> 00:38:20,334
I'm sorry you didn't know.

451
00:38:20,971 --> 00:38:22,398
You can go back...

452
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,803
if this is making you feel uncomfortable.

453
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,194
Mom.

454
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,562
Director Gold.

455
00:38:32,881 --> 00:38:34,686
If it's hard to be here as Heo Yoon Jae,

456
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:37,565
just think that you're here as a museum director.

457
00:38:38,221 --> 00:38:39,923
We need to hold the exhibition.

458
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:42,294
And in order to do that, we need to look at the painting.

459
00:38:52,761 --> 00:38:54,056
Can you show me...

460
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,325
your last painting?

461
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:02,134
Ms. Lee Sol.

462
00:39:37,781 --> 00:39:39,749
"Please protect this child."

463
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:44,666
That's what I prayed for as I decided to keep this here.

464
00:39:45,821 --> 00:39:47,116
You don't remember, do you?

465
00:39:48,091 --> 00:39:49,273
This is Yoon Jae.

466
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,082
Heo Yoon Jae.

467
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,444
Mom.

468
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:24,216
I'm hungry.

469
00:40:27,361 --> 00:40:29,431
Mom.

470
00:40:55,451 --> 00:40:56,541
Mom.

471
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,314
Mom, I'm hungry.

472
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,162
Mom.

473
00:41:21,051 --> 00:41:23,734
- What do you want to eat, Yoon Jae? - Doenjang soup.

474
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:25,553
- What? - Doenjang soup.

475
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:31,472
Mom, is this me?

476
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,592
- It's me. - Yes.

477
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,223
We're both...

478
00:42:17,671 --> 00:42:18,792
smiling.

479
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,806
We look very happy.

480
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,140
Mom, look at this!

481
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:58,023
Mom, did you see that?

482
00:43:02,511 --> 00:43:03,908
It's so pretty.

483
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:20,410
By the way, are you okay, Mr. Cha?

484
00:44:20,431 --> 00:44:21,756
I'm sure you were also startled.

485
00:44:24,031 --> 00:44:25,860
I might not have been as desperate as my mom,

486
00:44:25,861 --> 00:44:27,707
but I've also been waiting for this day.

487
00:44:28,901 --> 00:44:30,706
We finally found all of my mom's paintings.

488
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:33,241
And we even found Ryan, the child that my mom lost...

489
00:44:36,011 --> 00:44:37,336
because of her paintings.

490
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:42,228
By any chance, are you a saint from the skies?

491
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:44,812
People often ask me that.

492
00:44:46,921 --> 00:44:49,062
It's all thanks to you. Thank you.

493
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:50,513
It was nothing.

494
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:54,748
Ms. Lee, I'd like to officially introduce myself to you.

495
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:57,585
I'm Sung Deok Mi, the senior curator of Cheum Gallery.

496
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,089
What brings you here at this hour?

497
00:45:01,201 --> 00:45:04,607
I heard you know where the last painting is.

498
00:45:06,301 --> 00:45:08,869
I don't want my paintings to go public...

499
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:11,329
Will you take a look at this first?

500
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:21,820
(Cheum Gallery 5th Anniversary Celebrity Collection Exhibition)

501
00:45:21,821 --> 00:45:23,860
If people only see bits and pieces of your series,

502
00:45:23,861 --> 00:45:25,727
they'll all come up with different interpretations.

503
00:45:26,421 --> 00:45:28,429
But if we also exhibit the last piece,

504
00:45:28,861 --> 00:45:31,584
everyone who sees the paintings will be able to realize...

505
00:45:32,701 --> 00:45:34,811
the true meaning behind these paintings.

506
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:41,117
Your ardent affection toward a certain child.

507
00:45:45,341 --> 00:45:48,920
I really want to show that to Director Gold.

508
00:45:49,651 --> 00:45:51,416
Not just as a curator,

509
00:45:52,151 --> 00:45:54,741
but also for the happiness of the man I cherish.

510
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:57,312
You must like him very much.

511
00:45:57,790 --> 00:45:59,422
It's not just because of that.

512
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:01,218
I really want to hold...

513
00:46:02,361 --> 00:46:06,583
your official debut as an artist at Cheum Gallery.

514
00:46:08,531 --> 00:46:09,653
Please give us your approval.

515
00:46:18,781 --> 00:46:22,829
By the way, I've been wondering if I should ask you this or not.

516
00:46:23,181 --> 00:46:24,344
What is it?

517
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:28,241
- No, never mind. - What is it? You can ask me.

518
00:46:29,221 --> 00:46:32,627
By any chance, are you my fan?

519
00:46:34,591 --> 00:46:35,681
Your fan?

520
00:46:38,201 --> 00:46:41,300
- I like you, so I guess I am. - Right?

521
00:46:41,301 --> 00:46:42,930
Yes, I like your band's music.

522
00:46:42,931 --> 00:46:44,502
Thank you.

523
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:47,305
We're going to release a new song soon.

524
00:46:48,171 --> 00:46:49,269
What's the genre?

525
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:51,740
- It's going to be hip-hop... - Yes?

526
00:46:51,741 --> 00:46:54,434
mixed with a little bit of acoustic...

527
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:23,495
You finally saw every single one of Lee Sol's paintings.

528
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:24,932
How did it feel?

529
00:47:25,241 --> 00:47:27,189
I realized something once I saw the painting.

530
00:47:28,281 --> 00:47:29,913
She loved me...

531
00:47:30,781 --> 00:47:32,178
and protected me.

532
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:36,420
I was a boy who was loved.

533
00:47:36,451 --> 00:47:40,337
Then feel more of that love. I'll let your mother have you today.

534
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:46,952
Go on.

535
00:48:09,373 --> 00:48:12,503
Ms. Sung, the Chinese art dealer just called.

536
00:48:12,703 --> 00:48:15,059
The seller agreed to sell Lee Sol's paintings.

537
00:48:15,266 --> 00:48:16,112
Really?

538
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:18,488
We'll be able to put all nine paintings on display then.

539
00:48:18,643 --> 00:48:20,275
Did you locate the last one?

540
00:48:21,582 --> 00:48:23,285
Shipping will begin next week.

541
00:48:23,513 --> 00:48:25,421
Ms. Sung, Ms. Yu, we did it!

542
00:48:25,422 --> 00:48:27,592
The merchandise is 99 percent ready too.

543
00:48:27,593 --> 00:48:28,746
I just need to put them on display now.

544
00:48:28,993 --> 00:48:31,421
The exhibition will be held soon, so let's keep up the good work.

545
00:48:31,422 --> 00:48:32,483
Sure thing!

546
00:48:33,192 --> 00:48:36,803
Why didn't you tell me that moving artwork was this tiresome?

547
00:48:37,362 --> 00:48:40,463
I forgot how exhausting it can be.

548
00:48:40,632 --> 00:48:42,408
I wonder why we always forget.

549
00:48:42,832 --> 00:48:44,373
It makes us do it again next time.

550
00:48:47,013 --> 00:48:48,912
I know we're busy with the exhibition,

551
00:48:48,913 --> 00:48:51,941
but shouldn't we be treated to a nice team dinner?

552
00:48:52,413 --> 00:48:55,033
I am no longer in possession of my mom's credit card.

553
00:48:55,853 --> 00:48:59,117
Maybe Ms. Sung's boyfriend can pick up the bill.

554
00:48:59,482 --> 00:49:00,675
My boyfriend?

555
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:04,369
I'll cash in one of my coupons then.

556
00:49:04,922 --> 00:49:06,014
Get changed, guys.

557
00:49:06,422 --> 00:49:07,453
Nice!

558
00:49:09,163 --> 00:49:12,426
So these are the only places that I'm allowed to use?

559
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:14,604
That's not what we talked about.

560
00:49:14,632 --> 00:49:16,815
Additional pieces will be put on display...

561
00:49:16,902 --> 00:49:19,116
and everyone wants a decent amount of space.

562
00:49:19,743 --> 00:49:22,088
I'd appreciate your understanding.

563
00:49:25,882 --> 00:49:27,749
- Hello, Ms. Choi. - Hello.

564
00:49:28,652 --> 00:49:31,131
If you're not done here, I can always come back.

565
00:49:31,283 --> 00:49:32,344
We're done.

566
00:49:33,482 --> 00:49:34,574
Aren't we?

567
00:49:35,652 --> 00:49:37,835
You say we are, so what choice do I have?

568
00:49:38,393 --> 00:49:40,127
I have plans with a friend anyway.

569
00:49:40,323 --> 00:49:43,322
A friend? You have one in Korea?

570
00:49:44,362 --> 00:49:45,759
Yes, thanks to Ms. Sung.

571
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:49,371
I'll get going then.

572
00:49:49,565 --> 00:49:50,599
Good luck, guys.

573
00:49:52,902 --> 00:49:54,065
Thanks to me?

574
00:49:55,042 --> 00:49:56,094
So what are you here for?

575
00:49:56,643 --> 00:49:58,724
You have to pay up today.

576
00:49:59,442 --> 00:50:02,151
The staff members are exhausted from managing all the preparations.

577
00:50:02,152 --> 00:50:03,816
A team dinner would boost our spirits.

578
00:50:04,683 --> 00:50:07,711
Fine. How about that makgeolli place we went to?

579
00:50:07,752 --> 00:50:09,282
No way.

580
00:50:09,493 --> 00:50:11,603
- Why not? - You're really heavy.

581
00:50:13,123 --> 00:50:14,662
But I won't get drunk today.

582
00:50:15,433 --> 00:50:16,758
As if.

583
00:50:17,732 --> 00:50:20,079
"As if?"

584
00:50:20,632 --> 00:50:23,081
Why do two perfectly nice words sound sarcastic?

585
00:50:23,732 --> 00:50:25,508
Study up on your Korean and you'll know.

586
00:50:29,243 --> 00:50:30,843
Here's your iced Americano.

587
00:50:31,243 --> 00:50:33,456
Joo Hyuk, is it true that you're releasing an album?

588
00:50:34,382 --> 00:50:36,289
I'll sign it for you when it's released.

589
00:50:37,723 --> 00:50:39,517
You're what I call a successful fanatic.

590
00:50:40,082 --> 00:50:42,521
You went from his fan to his sponsor.

591
00:50:42,522 --> 00:50:45,175
It's crucial for fangirls to have a keen eye.

592
00:50:45,493 --> 00:50:48,594
I took time off from it all, but my taste is still there.

593
00:50:49,462 --> 00:50:51,033
It's why you married Seung Min...

594
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:53,955
Hey! Are you speaking ill of him?

595
00:50:54,772 --> 00:50:56,844
- I thought you two were fighting. - He's mine to bad-mouth.

596
00:51:00,172 --> 00:51:01,264
Hi.

597
00:51:02,272 --> 00:51:03,333
Hello.

598
00:51:03,542 --> 00:51:05,929
Who are you?

599
00:51:08,112 --> 00:51:09,509
I was here before.

600
00:51:10,823 --> 00:51:13,332
No, you're meeting her for the first time.

601
00:51:16,422 --> 00:51:17,891
Why did you want to see me?

602
00:51:18,593 --> 00:51:20,806
I'll be too busy once the exhibition starts,

603
00:51:20,893 --> 00:51:22,769
so we should get drinks before it begins.

604
00:51:24,263 --> 00:51:26,445
- On one condition. - No hopping bars.

605
00:51:29,803 --> 00:51:31,404
Can I use the restroom first?

606
00:51:35,873 --> 00:51:37,381
- Hi, Deok Mi. - Seon Joo, hi.

607
00:51:37,382 --> 00:51:39,046
I'll have to take a rain check.

608
00:51:39,112 --> 00:51:40,439
A team dinner came up.

609
00:51:40,582 --> 00:51:43,012
All my friends have plans this evening.

610
00:51:43,013 --> 00:51:44,380
Eun Gi has plans?

611
00:51:45,353 --> 00:51:46,952
Apparently, he has a new friend.

612
00:51:46,953 --> 00:51:48,352
She's not a friend.

613
00:51:48,353 --> 00:51:49,985
- A new friend? - Yes.

614
00:51:50,623 --> 00:51:51,822
They seemed close.

615
00:51:51,823 --> 00:51:53,191
She's not a friend!

616
00:51:53,192 --> 00:51:54,997
What will you be having tonight?

617
00:51:55,462 --> 00:51:57,574
It'll probably be makgeolli.

618
00:51:57,803 --> 00:52:00,005
It's Heo Yoon Jae's favorite.

619
00:52:00,332 --> 00:52:01,423
Heo Yoon Jae?

620
00:52:05,942 --> 00:52:08,072
It's Director Gold's Korean name.

621
00:52:08,073 --> 00:52:09,164
Even his name is pretty.

622
00:52:09,913 --> 00:52:11,208
I'll see you tomorrow then.

623
00:52:13,283 --> 00:52:15,424
It's really hard to see her these days.

624
00:52:16,712 --> 00:52:17,743
Seon Joo.

625
00:52:18,553 --> 00:52:19,879
Who's Heo Yoon Jae?

626
00:52:21,553 --> 00:52:23,852
Why did Deok Mi mention that name?

627
00:52:23,853 --> 00:52:25,392
It's Director Gold's Korean name.

628
00:52:25,922 --> 00:52:28,331
Director Ryan Gold?

629
00:52:28,332 --> 00:52:31,832
Yes, he must've figured out what he was called before his adoption.

630
00:52:37,542 --> 00:52:38,929
Let's go and get that drink.

631
00:52:40,442 --> 00:52:41,839
I'm afraid I'll have to decline.

632
00:52:42,573 --> 00:52:44,711
- Maybe next time. - There will be no next time.

633
00:52:44,712 --> 00:52:45,811
Like I said, I'll be too busy.

634
00:52:45,812 --> 00:52:48,260
We'll go for extra rounds next time. I'm sorry, but I have to go.

635
00:52:48,353 --> 00:52:49,403
Bye, Seon Joo.

636
00:52:49,953 --> 00:52:51,075
Bye.

637
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:57,646
If it's all right with you, we could drink together.

638
00:52:58,562 --> 00:52:59,715
I'm good.

639
00:53:00,792 --> 00:53:02,058
It'll probably be uncomfortable.

640
00:53:02,433 --> 00:53:03,514
Right.

641
00:54:16,303 --> 00:54:17,772
- Mom. - Yes?

642
00:54:19,843 --> 00:54:20,996
You know...

643
00:54:21,573 --> 00:54:22,735
What is it?

644
00:54:23,413 --> 00:54:24,463
Well...

645
00:54:25,942 --> 00:54:27,167
What is it?

646
00:54:29,082 --> 00:54:30,715
That boy...

647
00:54:34,323 --> 00:54:35,444
That boy?

648
00:54:36,323 --> 00:54:37,383
Yes.

649
00:54:38,422 --> 00:54:40,911
What was his name again?

650
00:54:45,462 --> 00:54:46,962
Why are you bringing him up?

651
00:54:48,603 --> 00:54:50,631
It's nothing, guys. Let's just eat.

652
00:54:50,632 --> 00:54:52,539
I don't know what came over me.

653
00:54:53,573 --> 00:54:54,633
Go on and eat.

654
00:54:58,942 --> 00:55:00,135
Here you go.

655
00:55:05,252 --> 00:55:06,881
For the special exhibition...

656
00:55:06,882 --> 00:55:09,575
Hold on a second. Isn't it Ms. Sung's birthday tomorrow?

657
00:55:09,953 --> 00:55:11,043
It probably is.

658
00:55:11,393 --> 00:55:12,762
We'll celebrate it as a group today,

659
00:55:12,763 --> 00:55:14,466
and you two can enjoy the day alone together tomorrow.

660
00:55:14,663 --> 00:55:16,906
What about the birthday cake though?

661
00:55:17,933 --> 00:55:19,800
(Place an order)

662
00:55:20,303 --> 00:55:23,026
I'm ordering it right now. It'll be here soon.

663
00:55:23,132 --> 00:55:24,602
- Here you go. - Thank you.

664
00:55:26,502 --> 00:55:29,368
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

665
00:55:29,843 --> 00:55:32,291
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

666
00:55:32,712 --> 00:55:35,916
- Happy birthday, dear Ms. Sung - Happy birthday, dear Ms. Sung

667
00:55:36,283 --> 00:55:40,363
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

668
00:55:42,953 --> 00:55:44,289
Thank you, everyone.

669
00:55:49,033 --> 00:55:50,664
The cake is really good.

670
00:55:54,132 --> 00:55:55,356
Cheers!

671
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:00,946
What are you doing?

672
00:56:01,112 --> 00:56:02,368
Are you keeping him on a tight leash?

673
00:56:02,643 --> 00:56:05,742
He won't drink a single drop of alcohol today.

674
00:56:05,743 --> 00:56:07,682
- I'm going to. - You can't.

675
00:56:07,683 --> 00:56:09,315
Are you taking herbal medicine?

676
00:56:09,612 --> 00:56:11,082
- No. - Then why not?

677
00:56:11,953 --> 00:56:14,063
He has something to do tonight.

678
00:56:15,323 --> 00:56:16,476
As in what?

679
00:56:16,652 --> 00:56:18,559
There's something we're going to do together.

680
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:21,589
That's TMI for sure.

681
00:56:31,042 --> 00:56:35,041
So, are you two really going to date or not?

682
00:56:35,042 --> 00:56:37,695
What? Who do you mean? Us?

683
00:56:38,183 --> 00:56:42,028
My goodness. That is absolutely never going to happen.

684
00:56:42,112 --> 00:56:45,447
You never know what might happen in life. How could you be so sure?

685
00:56:45,783 --> 00:56:46,904
Hey.

686
00:56:47,123 --> 00:56:50,418
We should at least know that nothing will happen between us.

687
00:56:53,292 --> 00:56:56,088
- What are you doing? - You should know how I feel too.

688
00:56:57,533 --> 00:56:59,631
Come on, please don't date!

689
00:56:59,632 --> 00:57:03,432
I can barely stand looking at these two dating.

690
00:57:03,433 --> 00:57:06,094
If you two date too, it'll be so annoying.

691
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:07,499
- Okay. - Calm down.

692
00:57:11,482 --> 00:57:12,666
Enjoy a second round.

693
00:57:12,783 --> 00:57:15,651
Director Gold, can't we go for a third round too?

694
00:57:15,652 --> 00:57:16,881
Knock yourself out.

695
00:57:16,882 --> 00:57:18,311
Thank you so much.

696
00:57:20,422 --> 00:57:22,361
- Let's go. - Good night.

697
00:57:24,462 --> 00:57:25,616
Have fun.

698
00:57:27,292 --> 00:57:28,761
What are we doing tonight?

699
00:57:29,033 --> 00:57:30,186
You didn't even let me drink.

700
00:57:31,562 --> 00:57:33,980
First of all, change into something comfortable. I'll wait.

701
00:58:19,212 --> 00:58:24,731
(Heo Yoon Jae)

702
00:58:29,792 --> 00:58:35,882
(Heo Yoon Jae)

703
00:58:54,042 --> 00:58:55,133
Deok Mi?

704
00:59:03,792 --> 00:59:04,883
Director Gold.

705
00:59:39,093 --> 00:59:41,336
Deok Mi, what is this?

706
00:59:43,062 --> 00:59:44,695
It's my birthday tomorrow.

707
00:59:46,703 --> 00:59:48,538
I want to receive a birthday gift.

708
01:00:00,343 --> 01:00:01,536
Draw my picture.

709
01:00:04,013 --> 01:00:05,247
You know that...

710
01:00:06,752 --> 01:00:08,221
I can't draw.

711
01:00:09,252 --> 01:00:10,416
You can do it.

712
01:00:11,123 --> 01:00:13,163
You drew my hand last time.

713
01:00:14,433 --> 01:00:15,656
Nothing has changed.

714
01:00:22,902 --> 01:00:24,056
I must remind you...

715
01:00:26,843 --> 01:00:28,576
that my profile is beautiful.

716
01:00:28,772 --> 01:00:31,434
But my neckline is even more gorgeous.

717
01:01:08,612 --> 01:01:10,898
How do I look? Don't you want to start drawing?

718
01:01:18,223 --> 01:01:21,292
You just have to trace the outlines of my face.

719
01:03:47,303 --> 01:03:48,496
It looks pretty.

720
01:03:49,542 --> 01:03:51,104
Artist Ryan Gold.

721
01:04:54,042 --> 01:04:55,165
I love you.

722
01:04:58,783 --> 01:04:59,904
I love you.

723
