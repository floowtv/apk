00:00:15,772 --> 00:00:17,672
Honey. Wait, just...

2
00:00:17,674 --> 00:00:19,207
<i>Non!</i> Bill, <i>Non!</i>

3
00:00:19,209 --> 00:00:22,544
Honey! You're overreacting.

4
00:00:22,546 --> 00:00:25,081
Am I, really? After I catch
you with Sharon and Cindy?

5
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:27,483
Babe, they mean nothing to me.

6
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:29,985
No, you know what? This is it.
It's over!

7
00:00:29,987 --> 00:00:33,723
What? Wait!
That cost me 150 bucks!

8
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,468
- David!
- David!

9
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:20,838
Up!

10
00:01:21,672 --> 00:01:23,838
Oh, God!

11
00:01:26,509 --> 00:01:28,579
Oh, my God!

00:02:56,233 --> 00:02:59,135
Here we have no phones,
no television, no Internet.

14
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,570
At Camp Heart of the Matter,
you will unplug to reconnect,

15
00:03:01,572 --> 00:03:04,207
working together
to repair your relationships.

16
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:05,607
So in order for you guys
to survive it here,

17
00:03:05,609 --> 00:03:07,542
you're gonna have
to work together.

18
00:03:07,544 --> 00:03:09,644
We're gonna be, uh, putting your
relationships up against nature.

19
00:03:09,646 --> 00:03:13,114
That way, we find out
exactly what's missing.

20
00:03:13,116 --> 00:03:14,683
Common struggle, that's love.

21
00:03:14,685 --> 00:03:17,653
That's what we believe here.
That's what we teach.

22
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,053
I need a volunteer.

23
00:03:19,055 --> 00:03:21,856
You two, you're up.

24
00:03:21,858 --> 00:03:22,891
Whoo-hoo!

25
00:03:22,893 --> 00:03:24,527
- Up you go.
- Yeah, yeah.

26
00:03:24,529 --> 00:03:26,328
- Just breathe through it.
- Focus your energy.

27
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,297
- Go! Go! Go!
- It'll pull you up, yeah.

28
00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:30,833
All right,
show some enthusiasm, guys.

29
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:32,768
You can do it, Angie, girl!

30
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,070
- Just flow! Flow!
- Move that ass!

31
00:03:34,072 --> 00:03:36,105
- Yeah, just breathe.
- Slowly. Take it easy.

32
00:03:36,107 --> 00:03:37,506
- What? Angie, please.
- You're shaking it.

33
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:39,174
- I'm not shaking it.
- Stop shaking it.

34
00:03:39,176 --> 00:03:41,709
- I'm nervous! Angie, please!
- Come on!

35
00:03:41,711 --> 00:03:44,146
Take it easy, guys!
Don't want you to get hurt!

36
00:03:44,148 --> 00:03:46,618
I'm not gonna get...
Ohh! I'm falling.

37
00:03:47,651 --> 00:03:49,017
Ahh! Whoo!

38
00:03:50,587 --> 00:03:52,755
- Okay.
- You okay?

39
00:03:52,757 --> 00:03:54,589
You did good.
Good job.

40
00:03:54,591 --> 00:03:56,124
We didn't even
make it halfway.

41
00:03:56,126 --> 00:03:58,160
Now, why do you think that is?

42
00:03:58,162 --> 00:04:00,896
Kip's lack
of muscular integrity.

43
00:04:00,898 --> 00:04:04,466
We gonna be... All right,
like Crocodile Dundee, huh?

44
00:04:04,468 --> 00:04:05,834
Who's that?

45
00:04:05,836 --> 00:04:07,403
Anybody else?

46
00:04:07,405 --> 00:04:09,304
It's impossible.
You can't do it.

47
00:04:09,306 --> 00:04:12,273
Sure you can.
Just focus your chi.

48
00:04:12,275 --> 00:04:14,275
If you want to ruin
your nail beds, I guess.

49
00:04:14,277 --> 00:04:16,044
If you go up one at a time

50
00:04:16,046 --> 00:04:17,747
and push each other up,
you can do it.

51
00:04:17,749 --> 00:04:20,182
Yeah, but that's
not the challenge, is it?

52
00:04:20,184 --> 00:04:22,686
You have to go together.
That's the point.

53
00:04:24,254 --> 00:04:26,388
Anybody else? Mary? James?

54
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,057
It's a wonderful exercise.

55
00:04:29,059 --> 00:04:32,761
I... I appreciate
your enthusiasm, James.

56
00:04:32,763 --> 00:04:34,297
Mary?

57
00:04:34,299 --> 00:04:36,299
I think I can do it.

58
00:04:36,301 --> 00:04:38,236
Well done, you two.

59
00:04:39,337 --> 00:04:40,505
Mary?

60
00:04:42,806 --> 00:04:46,641
If you do this on your own,
it's never gonna work.

61
00:04:46,643 --> 00:04:49,210
The balance you need to create
is too hard,

62
00:04:49,212 --> 00:04:53,318
so you need to do it
with each other to create...

63
00:04:54,953 --> 00:04:57,188
the equilibrium.

64
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,525
Ready?

65
00:05:08,898 --> 00:05:09,898
Whoo!

66
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,102
Good job!

67
00:05:12,369 --> 00:05:14,737
Common struggle,
we believe, is love.

68
00:05:14,739 --> 00:05:17,674
That's what we teach here,
and that's what we believe.

69
00:05:19,275 --> 00:05:22,044
You mean you and your wife?

70
00:05:22,046 --> 00:05:24,446
You said, uh,
"What we teach here."

71
00:05:24,448 --> 00:05:26,482
You mean you and your wife?

72
00:05:26,484 --> 00:05:29,186
I'm a facts kind of person,
you know, so...

73
00:05:31,188 --> 00:05:36,158
Yes, uh, Mary, my wife and I.

74
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,727
And where is
your wife, anyway?

75
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:42,098
All right, guys,
let's get into our pairs.

76
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,432
Let's line up
in two straight lines.

77
00:05:43,434 --> 00:05:45,470
I want to see what you got.

78
00:05:56,446 --> 00:05:58,948
- Wow. Wow.
- Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

79
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,752
Doing it alone.

80
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,590
Go!

81
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:09,193
- You rock!
- Whoo!

82
00:06:10,994 --> 00:06:13,231
12 years of gymnastics.

83
00:06:14,431 --> 00:06:16,764
- All right.
- Whoo-hoo!

84
00:06:16,766 --> 00:06:17,867
Good job, Mary!

85
00:06:17,869 --> 00:06:19,600
Yeah, you rocked it!

86
00:06:19,602 --> 00:06:21,239
Here we go.

87
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,143
Work together. Work together.

88
00:06:28,145 --> 00:06:30,381
Create that equilibrium, guys.

89
00:06:33,016 --> 00:06:34,783
There we go.

90
00:06:34,785 --> 00:06:37,856
There we go! There we go!

91
00:06:49,433 --> 00:06:50,768
Hey, Brad, Rebecca.

92
00:06:52,402 --> 00:06:56,071
Hey, Rebecca, Brad, can you get the
supplies onto the platform for me?

93
00:06:56,073 --> 00:06:58,172
I got to deal
with Suzanne and Zach.

94
00:06:58,174 --> 00:07:00,145
Copy that. We're on it.

95
00:07:02,446 --> 00:07:04,616
This, too, shall pass, buddy.

96
00:07:08,285 --> 00:07:10,386
All right,
good job, everybody!

97
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,321
Get your wet suits on.

98
00:07:12,323 --> 00:07:14,557
Get down to the beach
in 10 minutes.

99
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,624
Becky and Brad
will meet you there.

100
00:07:16,626 --> 00:07:18,794
I know I said there was
no water on the island,

101
00:07:18,796 --> 00:07:21,396
but I didn't say anything about
there not being any champagne.

102
00:07:21,398 --> 00:07:24,266
The first couple to get there,
they get the prize!

103
00:07:24,268 --> 00:07:25,266
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

104
00:07:25,268 --> 00:07:26,470
Well done.

105
00:07:33,477 --> 00:07:35,613
All work and no play.

106
00:08:15,686 --> 00:08:17,252
Whoa.

107
00:08:17,254 --> 00:08:18,853
There's a pretty big swell
out here.

108
00:08:18,855 --> 00:08:22,857
Yeah. Hey, we should
head out over the reef.

109
00:08:22,859 --> 00:08:25,261
I bet there's
some smoking sets out there.

110
00:08:25,263 --> 00:08:26,698
Let's go.

111
00:09:16,513 --> 00:09:18,548
What the hell was that?

112
00:09:21,317 --> 00:09:23,420
Whoa! Babe!

113
00:09:26,056 --> 00:09:27,890
Brad!

114
00:09:27,892 --> 00:09:29,326
Brad!

115
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,506
Brad!

116
00:09:58,455 --> 00:10:00,655
Do you really want
to do this now?

117
00:10:00,657 --> 00:10:02,824
I got people on the beach
mid-activity.

118
00:10:02,826 --> 00:10:05,193
I need the papers, Will.
I need them signed.

119
00:10:05,195 --> 00:10:06,560
I told you I was coming.

120
00:10:06,562 --> 00:10:07,628
In the middle of camp?

121
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,064
It's the beginning of camp.

122
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,732
I need your signature,
and that's it, okay?

123
00:10:10,734 --> 00:10:12,266
You can... You can keep the boat.

124
00:10:12,268 --> 00:10:15,904
Thanks. At least you're
keeping your, uh, standards.

125
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:17,573
Excuse me?

126
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:19,107
Well, I know
she's a fix-me-upper,

127
00:10:19,109 --> 00:10:20,909
but, what, she doesn't fit
into your lifestyle anymore?

128
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,478
William,
let's not do this now.

129
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,814
You and I
built this company together.

130
00:10:26,816 --> 00:10:28,549
And what?
You're just gonna throw it away?

131
00:10:28,551 --> 00:10:29,918
I am not throwing it away!

132
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,721
Therapy through action
is what this is.

133
00:10:32,723 --> 00:10:35,089
You're the therapist.
I'm the action.

134
00:10:35,091 --> 00:10:36,860
It works, because we work.

135
00:10:39,897 --> 00:10:43,633
Are you signing the papers
or not?

136
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,144
Some people
find it hard to let go.

137
00:10:54,611 --> 00:10:56,044
He has a point.

138
00:10:56,046 --> 00:10:59,848
Look, that business
isn't your business anymore.

139
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:03,821
It's time to move onwards
and upwards, yeah?

140
00:11:08,526 --> 00:11:09,994
Thanks.

141
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,596
No, you keep 'em.
I won't need two of them.

142
00:11:14,598 --> 00:11:17,065
Look, you might want
to give them to somebody else

143
00:11:17,067 --> 00:11:19,503
- at some point.
- No. I won't.

144
00:11:20,803 --> 00:11:24,238
Okay. Be careful out there.

145
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,774
I hear there's weather.

146
00:11:25,776 --> 00:11:27,242
Ah, it'll be good for them,
to remind them

147
00:11:27,244 --> 00:11:29,614
that they need to work together
to make it work.

148
00:11:50,066 --> 00:11:52,470
Aren't you
putting on your wet suit?

149
00:11:54,604 --> 00:11:56,771
The water's freezing here.

150
00:11:56,773 --> 00:12:00,141
We don't all have to go
on the supply run, do we?

151
00:12:00,143 --> 00:12:02,977
I want to explore the island.

152
00:12:02,979 --> 00:12:05,883
All you think about
is yourself.

153
00:12:06,917 --> 00:12:08,920
We came here
to work on being together.

154
00:12:10,253 --> 00:12:14,789
I am thinking about us
having unique life experiences.

155
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:17,157
Isn't that what we're all about?

156
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:19,696
No. Not right now.

157
00:12:21,263 --> 00:12:22,631
Just hear me out.

158
00:12:22,633 --> 00:12:26,571
There is a lab
very near to here.

159
00:12:27,671 --> 00:12:29,002
They used to do all kinds

160
00:12:29,004 --> 00:12:32,841
of weird-ass,
top-secret experiments,

161
00:12:32,843 --> 00:12:38,780
you know, like MK Ultra,
Operation Paperclip type stuff.

162
00:12:38,782 --> 00:12:42,050
Right, like Nazi scientists.

163
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:45,020
No, not that,

164
00:12:45,022 --> 00:12:46,858
something far worse.

165
00:12:48,091 --> 00:12:49,790
In the eighties,

166
00:12:49,792 --> 00:12:51,992
they did
some crazy animal experiments.

167
00:12:51,994 --> 00:12:53,728
You know Plum Island
off of New York?

168
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:54,929
No, I don't.

169
00:12:54,931 --> 00:12:56,798
They did all these kinds
of top-secret,

170
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,200
Cold War pathogen,
animal experiments.

171
00:12:59,202 --> 00:13:03,372
And this place made Plum Island
look like a petting zoo.

172
00:13:03,374 --> 00:13:05,907
Jake, you can't believe
everything you read on the Net.

173
00:13:05,909 --> 00:13:07,876
Okay, it wasn't the Net.
It was the Darknet.

174
00:13:07,878 --> 00:13:09,743
It's not safe, Jake.

175
00:13:09,745 --> 00:13:11,979
They shut it down years ago.

176
00:13:11,981 --> 00:13:14,149
After the Cold War,
they closed it down.

177
00:13:14,151 --> 00:13:16,184
We have to check it out.

178
00:13:16,186 --> 00:13:20,090
Come on. It's literally
just over that hill.

179
00:13:21,658 --> 00:13:23,791
And let me
tell you something else.

180
00:13:23,793 --> 00:13:28,798
That is where they invented
the Chihuahua.

181
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,367
You go to the lab.

182
00:13:32,369 --> 00:13:34,739
I'm making sure we have water.

183
00:13:38,707 --> 00:13:42,078
I'm taking care of us,
like always.

184
00:13:45,548 --> 00:13:47,516
Just wait for me
to put my wet suit on?

185
00:13:47,518 --> 00:13:49,119
Hurry up.

186
00:13:52,689 --> 00:13:54,725
This is really roughing it.

187
00:13:55,859 --> 00:13:59,126
You're gonna be okay,
sweetcakes.

188
00:13:59,128 --> 00:14:00,697
Come on. Hey.

189
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:18,181
FYI, he's a car salesman.

190
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,284
Yeah,
that's what it feels like.

191
00:14:22,286 --> 00:14:25,856
Yeah? What do you feel like?

192
00:14:26,656 --> 00:14:28,957
Are you flirting with me?

193
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,992
- What?
- No, you...

194
00:14:30,994 --> 00:14:33,931
you asked me what...
what I feel like.

195
00:14:37,133 --> 00:14:39,269
Can you help me
with my zipper?

196
00:14:49,146 --> 00:14:51,780
Didn't he say
we should work together?

197
00:14:51,782 --> 00:14:54,018
I don't bite.

198
00:15:10,301 --> 00:15:11,735
Okay.

199
00:15:14,537 --> 00:15:16,374
Uh, you...

200
00:15:18,175 --> 00:15:19,174
I'm sorry.

201
00:15:19,176 --> 00:15:20,176
It's fine?

202
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:25,950
Kip.

203
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,757
Could you get my bag
from the shelf, please?

204
00:15:46,369 --> 00:15:49,771
You talk to my man again,
I'll zip you up so tight

205
00:15:49,773 --> 00:15:52,308
you'll need a plastic surgeon
to get it loose.

206
00:15:53,676 --> 00:15:54,878
You got it?

207
00:16:07,858 --> 00:16:10,791
We're not gonna
get our money back, and not now.

208
00:16:10,793 --> 00:16:14,864
Then you're gonna have
to eat it, because I'm done.

209
00:16:15,965 --> 00:16:18,000
We haven't even
been here one day,

210
00:16:18,002 --> 00:16:20,068
and you're just
gonna give up like that?

211
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:22,804
I'm not giving up.

212
00:16:22,806 --> 00:16:27,311
I just don't think this obstacle
course therapy is gonna help!

213
00:16:29,312 --> 00:16:31,512
I must have missed it
in the fine print,

214
00:16:31,514 --> 00:16:35,317
but I didn't read where it said
I have to swim for my supper!

215
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:38,453
James, you haven't even
given it a chance yet.

216
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:46,694
We need time, time together.

217
00:16:46,696 --> 00:16:48,796
We need to be together,

218
00:16:48,798 --> 00:16:53,369
not surrounded by all
these neurotic strangers.

219
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:55,773
You know what?

220
00:16:56,873 --> 00:16:59,274
I don't like
how that guy looks at you.

221
00:16:59,276 --> 00:17:00,742
What?

222
00:17:00,744 --> 00:17:05,245
You think it's any coincidence
the camp counselor picks you?

223
00:17:05,247 --> 00:17:08,517
I am not the one
with the wandering eye, James!

224
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:11,286
You're the one...
You're the one that went to go...

225
00:17:11,288 --> 00:17:12,389
I gave it a shot!

226
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,061
I tried it.

227
00:17:21,464 --> 00:17:24,268
I am done with this place.

228
00:17:28,671 --> 00:17:30,006
Fine.

229
00:17:31,975 --> 00:17:33,274
Where are you going?

230
00:17:33,276 --> 00:17:35,011
Deal with this.

231
00:17:36,613 --> 00:17:38,281
Perfect.

232
00:17:40,216 --> 00:17:41,451
Perfect.

233
00:18:05,475 --> 00:18:07,908
You did an impressive job
building that campaign,

234
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:09,578
but you should be
in the city, you know,

235
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,480
where you can be recognized
for your talents.

236
00:18:11,482 --> 00:18:13,917
We'll build something
bigger and better.

237
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:17,087
Are you listening to me?

238
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:19,921
Come. Wakey!

239
00:18:19,923 --> 00:18:21,422
Whoa.

240
00:18:21,424 --> 00:18:22,590
What was that?

241
00:18:22,592 --> 00:18:24,559
Did we hit something?

242
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:27,495
I told you we shouldn't be
coming close to this island.

243
00:18:27,497 --> 00:18:30,632
Submerged rocks everywhere.

244
00:18:30,634 --> 00:18:32,036
Let me look.

245
00:18:47,317 --> 00:18:49,086
Anything?

246
00:18:50,454 --> 00:18:54,591
No.

247
00:18:55,591 --> 00:18:56,924
Okay.

248
00:18:56,926 --> 00:18:59,263
I'll take it slow.

249
00:19:14,843 --> 00:19:17,011
Brad, Becky,

250
00:19:17,013 --> 00:19:19,183
go for Will. Over.

251
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:35,229
Will?

252
00:19:35,231 --> 00:19:38,199
Hey, Rebecca, come in. Over.

253
00:19:38,201 --> 00:19:40,134
- Will?
- Hey, Mary.

254
00:19:40,136 --> 00:19:41,536
Rebecca, come in. Over.

255
00:19:41,538 --> 00:19:46,308
Hey, Will, um,
James wants to leave.

256
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,710
Yeah, sometimes
on the first day, that happens.

257
00:19:48,712 --> 00:19:51,413
No, no, no. He... He didn't want
to come here in the first place.

258
00:19:51,415 --> 00:19:53,915
This whole thing was my idea.
I think I made a mistake.

259
00:19:53,917 --> 00:19:56,283
Are you listening to me?
I'm trying to tell you that...

260
00:19:56,285 --> 00:19:58,919
- that James and I are leaving.
- Yeah.

261
00:19:58,921 --> 00:20:02,022
I think that you'd do great
at this camp if you commit.

262
00:20:02,024 --> 00:20:04,925
What? No, I-I'm committed.
It's James.

263
00:20:04,927 --> 00:20:06,395
I'm really doing
the best that I can

264
00:20:06,397 --> 00:20:08,229
to make this whole thing work,
but he just...

265
00:20:08,231 --> 00:20:11,468
So you... you walked that arch
all on your own.

266
00:20:12,301 --> 00:20:13,635
- The arch?
- Yeah.

267
00:20:13,637 --> 00:20:15,302
What has that
got to do with anything?

268
00:20:15,304 --> 00:20:16,671
Well, you could have
done this together,

269
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,741
but you decided to come
and do this on your own.

270
00:20:19,743 --> 00:20:21,309
Wait. Are you blaming me?

271
00:20:21,311 --> 00:20:23,845
Yeah, exactly, both of you.

272
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,813
I mean... Come on.

273
00:20:25,815 --> 00:20:28,215
This is what
all of this is about,

274
00:20:28,217 --> 00:20:30,251
- radical responsibility...
- Okay, stop right...

275
00:20:30,253 --> 00:20:32,220
for both parties.

276
00:20:32,222 --> 00:20:33,521
I walked that arch by myself,

277
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:35,991
because I can,
and because I'm right.

278
00:20:35,993 --> 00:20:38,227
So you'd rather be right
than happy?

279
00:20:39,896 --> 00:20:42,195
I would rather
have my money back.

280
00:20:42,197 --> 00:20:44,965
- Ah, okay.
- Yeah.

281
00:20:44,967 --> 00:20:48,304
You're... You're really trying
to piss off a lawyer?

282
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,838
Here we go.

283
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,273
What, you want to go there?

284
00:20:53,275 --> 00:20:55,176
Yeah, let's go there,

285
00:20:55,178 --> 00:20:57,578
and let's start
with false advertising,

286
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:00,447
'cause this place here is
nowhere near up to the standards

287
00:21:00,449 --> 00:21:02,216
that you set up
in your documentation.

288
00:21:02,218 --> 00:21:05,720
Those pictures on your website,
they're of Hawaii.

289
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:06,954
Is this place Hawaii?

290
00:21:06,956 --> 00:21:08,822
You knew exactly
where I was taking you.

291
00:21:08,824 --> 00:21:11,826
It's not like I blindfolded you
when I brought you to Ensenada.

292
00:21:11,828 --> 00:21:14,896
Look, we came here
to work with Suzanne Nix, okay,

293
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:16,431
your wife. Where is she?

294
00:21:16,433 --> 00:21:17,999
She was advertised
in the brochure.

295
00:21:18,001 --> 00:21:19,466
All of us came here for her.

296
00:21:19,468 --> 00:21:21,034
This place is nothing
without her.

297
00:21:21,036 --> 00:21:23,405
No. No, no.

298
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:26,609
This place
is nothing without you.

299
00:21:27,811 --> 00:21:29,777
I'm in contract law, okay,
so if you think

300
00:21:29,779 --> 00:21:31,979
- I'm just gonna...
- Okay, okay, okay. Okay.

301
00:21:31,981 --> 00:21:33,213
You... You want to go home?

302
00:21:33,215 --> 00:21:34,982
I'll take you home
tomorrow. Happy?

303
00:21:34,984 --> 00:21:37,786
No. I want to go home now.

304
00:21:37,788 --> 00:21:39,820
Aw, come on, Mary. I've got
other people on this island.

305
00:21:39,822 --> 00:21:42,424
And don't... don't worry about it.
You'll get a full refund.

306
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:45,225
But just remember,
you came here for a reason.

307
00:21:45,227 --> 00:21:49,132
I want you to think about
that reason before you quit.

308
00:21:50,367 --> 00:21:52,332
Okay?

309
00:21:52,334 --> 00:21:54,138
Okay.

310
00:21:55,504 --> 00:22:00,244
Hey, Brad, Rebecca, you copy?
Over.

311
00:22:01,512 --> 00:22:04,748
Hey, Brad, Rebecca, do you copy?

312
00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:08,185
Brad, do you copy? Over.

313
00:22:09,386 --> 00:22:12,156
Rebecca, go for Will. Over?

314
00:22:36,413 --> 00:22:37,681
So?

315
00:22:39,282 --> 00:22:40,850
We're leaving tomorrow.

316
00:22:43,218 --> 00:22:44,620
It's the best I could do.

317
00:22:54,263 --> 00:22:57,367
Just needed a little more time
with your boyfriend?

318
00:23:01,304 --> 00:23:04,772
Hey, lawyer gymnast,
you gonna get in the water?

319
00:23:04,774 --> 00:23:08,579
Bet you're rockin'
a secret hot bod under there.

320
00:23:09,645 --> 00:23:13,117
You know what, Daphne?
Maybe I will.

321
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:17,553
Oh! You go, girl!

322
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,859
Yaah!

323
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,796
I-I got the zipper! Heh!

324
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:30,467
Phoebe!

325
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,716
Hey, guys,
stop fooling around.

326
00:23:49,718 --> 00:23:50,888
Come in. Over.

327
00:24:10,939 --> 00:24:12,240
Whoo!

328
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,177
Ha ha!

329
00:24:22,653 --> 00:24:24,655
Ha! I got it.

330
00:24:26,822 --> 00:24:28,658
Rebecca, come in.

331
00:24:30,026 --> 00:24:32,328
Brad, man, can somebody come in?

332
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:39,099
How the hell did he win?

333
00:24:39,101 --> 00:24:41,669
- Whew.
- Whew.

334
00:24:41,671 --> 00:24:44,938
Who's the greatest now,
great white hunter?

335
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,709
Whoo!

336
00:24:50,546 --> 00:24:52,480
Come on, Mary!

337
00:24:52,482 --> 00:24:53,714
- Whoo!
- Go, Mary!

338
00:24:53,716 --> 00:24:55,049
You can do it!

339
00:24:56,186 --> 00:24:57,853
Come on!

340
00:25:05,528 --> 00:25:07,731
Come on, Mary!

341
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:13,033
- Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Yeah!
- Come on!

342
00:25:13,035 --> 00:25:15,905
- Go on!
- Go on, Mary!

343
00:25:18,073 --> 00:25:19,540
- Get up here, man!
- Hey!

344
00:25:19,542 --> 00:25:21,209
What's up? What's going on?

345
00:25:21,211 --> 00:25:23,447
- Oh, God. What's wrong?
- What?

346
00:25:25,215 --> 00:25:26,850
She's gonna... She's gonna...

347
00:25:28,384 --> 00:25:29,983
She's gonna... She's gonna...

348
00:25:29,985 --> 00:25:31,722
Don't get in the water!

349
00:25:33,222 --> 00:25:34,489
Don't get in the water!

350
00:25:39,696 --> 00:25:41,398
Oh, my God!

351
00:25:43,366 --> 00:25:45,265
I got you!

352
00:25:45,267 --> 00:25:47,166
Oh! Come on! Come on!

353
00:25:47,168 --> 00:25:49,438
Get her up! Get her up!

354
00:25:51,206 --> 00:25:52,876
Get her up!

355
00:25:55,177 --> 00:25:56,744
Come on. Come on.

356
00:25:56,746 --> 00:25:58,378
Oh, my God!

357
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,617
Th-That's Brad!

358
00:26:02,385 --> 00:26:03,753
Oh, my God. I'm gonna be sick.

359
00:26:09,592 --> 00:26:13,161
Sweet Mother Earth,

360
00:26:13,163 --> 00:26:14,861
that was a shark, wasn't it?

361
00:26:14,863 --> 00:26:18,199
This is Baja.
It's great white territory.

362
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:21,202
W-Wait! Wait!
Who knew about this?!

363
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:23,507
- Everybody knew that!
- Oh, my God.

364
00:26:25,273 --> 00:26:28,477
Well, don't let that
get in the water. It's chum.

365
00:26:31,246 --> 00:26:33,616
It's okay. I got you.

366
00:26:36,019 --> 00:26:37,020
All right, listen up.

367
00:26:38,321 --> 00:26:39,822
We're gonna get to the boat.

368
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:44,291
But we gotta swim.

369
00:26:44,293 --> 00:26:46,359
Are you crazy?

370
00:26:46,361 --> 00:26:48,930
There's no way we're getting
back in the water again!

371
00:26:48,932 --> 00:26:51,965
Listen, the tide is too low for
me to bring the boat in here.

372
00:26:51,967 --> 00:26:53,200
There are too many rocks.

373
00:26:53,202 --> 00:26:56,470
I might put a hole in the hull,
and then where are we?

374
00:26:56,472 --> 00:26:58,472
We gotta swim.

375
00:26:58,474 --> 00:26:59,607
I'm with her.

376
00:26:59,609 --> 00:27:00,808
Honey, honey,
honey, honey, honey,

377
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:03,110
Hey, hey, hey,
we have to do this, baby.

378
00:27:03,112 --> 00:27:04,345
Okay?

379
00:27:04,347 --> 00:27:05,549
Yeah.

380
00:27:08,318 --> 00:27:10,251
What if we wait
for the tide to come in?

381
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:11,719
Nah, nah. The... The swell...

382
00:27:11,721 --> 00:27:15,359
the platform is way too unstable
for us all to be on it.

383
00:27:17,225 --> 00:27:20,861
I got a plan, but it's
gonna require teamwork.

384
00:27:20,863 --> 00:27:23,630
I am so sick of your teamwork!

385
00:27:23,632 --> 00:27:26,834
The only team you're gonna need
is a team of attorneys!

386
00:27:26,836 --> 00:27:28,868
- No!
- When we get back to the U.S....

387
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:31,405
- Shut up!
- Look where it's gotten us!

388
00:27:31,407 --> 00:27:33,774
Shut up, all of you!

389
00:27:33,776 --> 00:27:34,841
I'm gonna take
everything you own!

390
00:27:34,843 --> 00:27:36,610
- I said shut up!
- All right!

391
00:27:36,612 --> 00:27:39,547
That's my staff, man!
I know you're angry, okay?

392
00:27:39,549 --> 00:27:41,048
Brad is dead!
Rebecca's missing!

393
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:43,684
All I'm trying to do
is keep you alive,

394
00:27:43,686 --> 00:27:45,452
so listen to what I have to say!

395
00:27:45,454 --> 00:27:48,425
This is what we gotta do!

396
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:54,422
Mayday! Mayday!
This is the <i>Sweet Waters!</i>

397
00:28:54,424 --> 00:28:57,594
<i>Está es</i> the <i>Sweet Waters.</i>

398
00:28:58,928 --> 00:29:02,666
Calling the <i>Búsqueda
y Rescate Marítimo.</i>

399
00:29:04,833 --> 00:29:07,600
Mayday! Mayday!
This is <i>Sweet Waters.</i>

400
00:29:07,602 --> 00:29:09,071
Come in. Over.

401
00:29:13,642 --> 00:29:15,342
There's too much
radio interference.

402
00:29:15,344 --> 00:29:16,743
We're on our own.

403
00:29:16,745 --> 00:29:19,245
Okay, seriously,
who knew this is shark country?

404
00:29:19,247 --> 00:29:22,716
This is the ocean.
It's all shark country.

405
00:29:22,718 --> 00:29:24,417
Then what are we waiting for?

406
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:25,719
Let's get out of here.

407
00:29:25,721 --> 00:29:28,288
Rebecca is still out there.

408
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:30,624
So what are the chances
she's not already dead?

409
00:29:30,626 --> 00:29:31,893
Whoa, hey, we don't know that.

410
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,394
So what are you gonna do?

411
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:34,962
We're gonna find her,

412
00:29:34,964 --> 00:29:37,164
and we're gonna kill that shark.

413
00:29:37,166 --> 00:29:38,933
You got a flare gun?

414
00:29:38,935 --> 00:29:41,735
- Yeah.
- Give me a shell.

415
00:29:41,737 --> 00:29:43,803
I'm gonna make a bang stick,

416
00:29:43,805 --> 00:29:45,371
jab it into the shark's head,

417
00:29:45,373 --> 00:29:46,807
and blow its brains out.

418
00:29:46,809 --> 00:29:49,376
A bang stick?
A bang... A bang...

419
00:29:49,378 --> 00:29:52,713
He's gonna... He's gonna make
a bang stick, everyone!

420
00:29:52,715 --> 00:29:54,147
You guys are nuts!

421
00:29:54,149 --> 00:29:56,450
Duke, people are dead.
That thing...

422
00:29:56,452 --> 00:29:57,751
Is a stupid shark.

423
00:29:57,753 --> 00:30:00,588
We're the apex predators here.

424
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,292
Brilliant.

425
00:30:03,591 --> 00:30:06,327
That was brilliant.
"Apex predators."

426
00:30:07,664 --> 00:30:09,829
- Keep an eye on it.
- If you leave this boat,

427
00:30:09,831 --> 00:30:11,831
I will sue you
for everything you got, man.

428
00:30:11,833 --> 00:30:13,599
You can sue me all you want.

429
00:30:13,601 --> 00:30:16,503
This is still my boat,
my island,

430
00:30:16,505 --> 00:30:18,975
and I am not leaving
without Rebecca.

431
00:30:20,909 --> 00:30:22,576
Duke, look, please don't go.

432
00:30:22,578 --> 00:30:25,378
Ah, Jitterbug,
who you gonna bet on,

433
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,716
shark or me, huh?

434
00:30:31,887 --> 00:30:36,857
Great. I'll watch over them.

435
00:30:36,859 --> 00:30:39,329
You can count on me!

436
00:31:18,967 --> 00:31:21,103
Hey, we need duct tape.

437
00:31:22,504 --> 00:31:25,341
I'll... I'll go find some...

438
00:31:39,021 --> 00:31:40,724
Tape it up. Over there.

439
00:31:45,128 --> 00:31:46,229
Tape it face-up.

440
00:31:47,763 --> 00:31:51,098
We'll ram this into that sucker,
and it's goodbye, Johnny.

441
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,403
Let's go.
We need to find Rebecca.

442
00:31:54,969 --> 00:31:57,471
We can't just sit here.

443
00:31:57,473 --> 00:31:59,440
Yeah, we can, and we will.

444
00:31:59,442 --> 00:32:02,510
That was the most awful thing
I've ever seen in my life.

445
00:32:02,512 --> 00:32:04,047
Hey, hey.

446
00:32:05,115 --> 00:32:06,316
Becky?!

447
00:32:09,318 --> 00:32:11,684
Rebecca?

448
00:32:11,686 --> 00:32:12,955
There.

449
00:32:17,392 --> 00:32:18,459
What?

450
00:32:18,461 --> 00:32:21,494
There's a shadow in the water.

451
00:32:21,496 --> 00:32:23,332
We gotta find Rebecca!

452
00:32:25,834 --> 00:32:28,270
Rebecca's dead.

453
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,948
Somewhere over there.

454
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,493
What are you doing?

455
00:32:53,495 --> 00:32:56,196
I'm ringing the dinner bell.

456
00:32:56,198 --> 00:32:58,765
Here. Take this.

457
00:32:58,767 --> 00:33:02,237
Poke it in the eye
if it gets close.

458
00:33:03,472 --> 00:33:04,773
Come on.

459
00:33:09,611 --> 00:33:11,180
Come to Daddy.

460
00:33:15,784 --> 00:33:17,986
Come on, come on.

461
00:33:22,491 --> 00:33:24,058
What is he doing?

462
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,560
- Duke!
- He's getting in the water.

463
00:33:26,562 --> 00:33:28,596
What is that?

464
00:33:28,598 --> 00:33:30,197
What are they doing?

465
00:33:30,199 --> 00:33:32,065
Someone pull the anchors.

466
00:33:32,067 --> 00:33:33,800
Duke, get out of there!

467
00:33:33,802 --> 00:33:35,469
They told us not to move.

468
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:37,570
Well, someone's
got to help them.

469
00:33:37,572 --> 00:33:40,574
- Get out of there now!
- We've got to move.

470
00:33:40,576 --> 00:33:41,878
Duke!

471
00:33:45,514 --> 00:33:46,749
Let's go!

472
00:34:17,612 --> 00:34:19,281
What the hell is that?!

473
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:22,449
Shark!

474
00:34:22,451 --> 00:34:23,953
- Shark!
- Shark!

475
00:34:35,931 --> 00:34:38,299
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah.

476
00:34:38,301 --> 00:34:40,099
Who's your Daddy?
Who's your Daddy?

477
00:34:40,101 --> 00:34:42,369
I'm the man. I'm the man.

478
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,177
Can I tell you the truth?

479
00:34:50,011 --> 00:34:52,945
I've never killed
anything before.

480
00:34:52,947 --> 00:34:55,148
Angie hates hunting.

481
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:57,116
Guess who my hero is.

482
00:34:57,118 --> 00:34:59,555
I don't know. Gandhi?

483
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:02,590
No, Hemingway,

484
00:35:02,592 --> 00:35:04,891
He was a great white hunter,

485
00:35:04,893 --> 00:35:07,828
and I just killed a white shark.

486
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:09,496
- Duke.
- Yeah?

487
00:35:09,498 --> 00:35:11,067
Duke!

488
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:21,277
Duke! Duke!

489
00:35:32,987 --> 00:35:40,128
Aaaaah!

490
00:35:44,032 --> 00:35:46,534
No! No! No!

491
00:35:46,536 --> 00:35:49,172
No! No!

492
00:36:08,391 --> 00:36:11,391
- What happened?
- What's going on?

493
00:36:11,393 --> 00:36:12,726
I feel like we hit a rock.

494
00:36:12,728 --> 00:36:14,261
I'm gonna go check.

495
00:36:14,263 --> 00:36:16,266
- Jake!
- Hold on.

496
00:36:19,735 --> 00:36:20,768
No.

497
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:22,205
We've run aground!

498
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,572
We have to get going!

499
00:36:25,574 --> 00:36:27,644
We're stuck!

500
00:36:29,444 --> 00:36:32,380
We're not that far
from the rocks.

501
00:36:32,382 --> 00:36:33,947
There's a big hole
in the hull.

502
00:36:33,949 --> 00:36:35,514
How bad is it?

503
00:36:35,516 --> 00:36:36,983
I don't know, it could be
a big hole in the hull.

504
00:36:36,985 --> 00:36:38,253
- In the hull?
- Yeah.

505
00:37:20,462 --> 00:37:22,329
Oh, God,
did you see that thing?

506
00:37:22,331 --> 00:37:23,965
I mean, did you see it?

507
00:37:23,967 --> 00:37:25,965
- What the hell was that?
- It was so awful.

508
00:37:25,967 --> 00:37:29,272
It was so awful, the most
awful thing I've ever seen.

509
00:37:30,772 --> 00:37:32,905
We have to get this going.

510
00:37:32,907 --> 00:37:34,139
We're stuck.

511
00:37:34,141 --> 00:37:35,375
It's coming at us!

512
00:37:35,377 --> 00:37:38,413
It's coming at us!

513
00:37:58,301 --> 00:38:00,366
You gotta get
off the boat now.

514
00:38:00,368 --> 00:38:03,372
You've run aground.
You're not going anywhere.

515
00:38:04,672 --> 00:38:07,139
Are you kidding me?

516
00:38:07,141 --> 00:38:09,041
You want us to swim?

517
00:38:09,043 --> 00:38:11,214
The beach
is really not that far.

518
00:38:12,014 --> 00:38:13,846
Are you insane? Insane?!

519
00:38:13,848 --> 00:38:16,349
Here, you will die for sure!

520
00:38:16,351 --> 00:38:18,788
If we get off, there's
a chance that we can survive!

521
00:38:20,056 --> 00:38:22,456
I don't know
where that thing is. I...

522
00:38:22,458 --> 00:38:25,125
And I don't know
when it's coming back!

523
00:38:25,127 --> 00:38:27,194
We gotta go!

524
00:38:27,196 --> 00:38:28,730
We gotta go now!

525
00:38:42,712 --> 00:38:44,610
Will it taste blood?

526
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:53,387
Oh, stop!

527
00:38:53,389 --> 00:38:54,989
Okay, Daphne, it's your turn.
Let's go.

528
00:38:54,991 --> 00:38:56,857
I'm not going
out into the water.

529
00:38:56,859 --> 00:38:59,592
Duke is still out there,
and part of him might...

530
00:38:59,594 --> 00:39:01,529
I'm not going.

531
00:39:01,531 --> 00:39:03,262
Listen to me, Daphne.
If you stay on this boat,

532
00:39:03,264 --> 00:39:05,232
you're gonna die,
we're both gonna die.

533
00:39:05,234 --> 00:39:07,967
We go for a swim, we stand
a chance of surviving, okay?

534
00:39:07,969 --> 00:39:11,070
Do this. Do this for Duke.

535
00:39:11,072 --> 00:39:13,408
I make fun of him.

536
00:39:14,509 --> 00:39:16,009
What?

537
00:39:16,011 --> 00:39:18,478
I make fun of Duke.

538
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,250
I made fun of him
behind his back all the time,

539
00:39:23,252 --> 00:39:25,788
'cause he's a fun guy. He's...

540
00:39:27,522 --> 00:39:29,424
I'm not a bad person.

541
00:39:30,393 --> 00:39:32,058
He brought me here
to fix this, us,

542
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,994
and I laughed at him.

543
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:35,695
I should die, too.

544
00:39:35,697 --> 00:39:36,833
No!

545
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:40,567
Hey, you know, Daphne,

546
00:39:40,569 --> 00:39:42,839
sometimes these things happen.

547
00:39:44,172 --> 00:39:46,040
Duke knew that you
loved him, okay?

548
00:39:46,042 --> 00:39:48,308
- Did he?
- Yeah.

549
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:50,545
Did he tell you that,
that he knew it?

550
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,882
Yeah, he told me.

551
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:01,590
Can we go?

552
00:40:02,523 --> 00:40:04,657
Let's do this for Duke, okay?

553
00:40:04,659 --> 00:40:07,163
Here we go. Come on.

554
00:40:21,308 --> 00:40:23,211
Come on!

555
00:40:33,089 --> 00:40:34,556
Come on.

556
00:40:37,592 --> 00:40:38,594
Come on.

557
00:40:46,802 --> 00:40:49,205
They're gonna
get killed out there!

558
00:41:04,085 --> 00:41:05,819
- Shark!
- Come on!

559
00:41:05,821 --> 00:41:07,119
- Shark!
- Come on!

560
00:41:07,121 --> 00:41:08,255
Shark! Come on!

561
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:09,855
- Come on!
- Shark!

562
00:41:09,857 --> 00:41:11,891
- Come on! Shark!
- Come on! Hurry up!

563
00:41:11,893 --> 00:41:13,527
Shark! Shark!

564
00:41:13,529 --> 00:41:15,094
- Come on!
- Swim!

565
00:41:15,096 --> 00:41:17,832
Go! Come on!

566
00:41:20,136 --> 00:41:22,235
- Oh, my God!
- Go! Go! Go! Swim! Swim!

567
00:41:22,237 --> 00:41:24,407
Go! Go! Swim!

568
00:41:37,386 --> 00:41:39,956
- Come on!
- Come on!

569
00:41:40,989 --> 00:41:42,891
Get out. Come on!

570
00:41:44,659 --> 00:41:47,629
I'm good. Okay. Okay.

571
00:42:02,844 --> 00:42:04,813
It's your fault.

572
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,382
Yeah, it is.

573
00:42:09,384 --> 00:42:12,052
Oh, so you admit it?

574
00:42:12,054 --> 00:42:13,219
Yeah.

575
00:42:13,221 --> 00:42:14,587
Well, good,

576
00:42:14,589 --> 00:42:17,824
'cause we are
gonna sue you for real.

577
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:21,694
We're all gonna sue you
and ruin you!

578
00:42:21,696 --> 00:42:25,099
You're gonna go to jail
for what you've done!

579
00:42:25,101 --> 00:42:27,166
- She's gonna be our lawyer.
- Aw, forget her.

580
00:42:27,168 --> 00:42:30,070
We'll get a real lawyer.

581
00:42:52,127 --> 00:42:53,259
Jake! Jake!

582
00:42:53,261 --> 00:42:55,027
- Stop!
- Jake! All right!

583
00:42:55,029 --> 00:42:56,429
Get off him!

584
00:42:56,431 --> 00:42:57,596
All right, guys...

585
00:42:57,598 --> 00:42:59,366
- Jake!
- All right, stop.

586
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:01,101
Get off of him!

587
00:43:02,471 --> 00:43:04,471
What is your problem, man?

588
00:43:04,473 --> 00:43:06,471
Enough!
Let it go, both of you!

589
00:43:06,473 --> 00:43:08,308
- Stop!
- Wait!

590
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:10,946
Wait! Stop! Look!

591
00:43:44,478 --> 00:43:48,451
My God, mammatus clouds.

592
00:43:49,985 --> 00:43:53,219
Those wall clouds are
a sure sign of severe weather.

593
00:43:53,221 --> 00:43:55,989
A supercell thunderstorm
inside those anvil clouds

594
00:43:55,991 --> 00:43:58,027
could house tornados
and who knows what.

595
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:02,161
This whole island
will be deluged.

596
00:44:02,163 --> 00:44:06,833
We're going to end up underwater
or blown into the ocean.

597
00:44:06,835 --> 00:44:08,601
- How do you know that?
- She's a weathergirl.

598
00:44:08,603 --> 00:44:10,704
Meteorologist, Jake!

599
00:44:10,706 --> 00:44:12,605
With this island swamped,
that thing will...

600
00:44:12,607 --> 00:44:14,608
...cover all of us.

601
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:15,842
So, what are we gonna do?

602
00:44:15,844 --> 00:44:17,945
There's an old
World War I lighthouse

603
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:20,712
on the south side of the beach.
We can camp there.

604
00:44:20,714 --> 00:44:22,014
We're not going there.

605
00:44:22,016 --> 00:44:24,050
If we're gonna
weather the storm, we are.

606
00:44:24,052 --> 00:44:26,420
That's a 40-minute walk
in the direction of the storm!

607
00:44:26,422 --> 00:44:28,087
We'll never make it
before it hits!

608
00:44:28,089 --> 00:44:29,790
We need to get to cover now!

609
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,925
What if we go to the camp?

610
00:44:31,927 --> 00:44:34,561
They're just above
the tide line. They're not safe.

611
00:44:34,563 --> 00:44:36,762
Which is why we need
to get to the lighthouse.

612
00:44:36,764 --> 00:44:38,433
We'll never make it!

613
00:44:39,266 --> 00:44:40,300
We could go to the lab.

614
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:41,504
It's right over there.

615
00:44:42,703 --> 00:44:44,605
Didn't you say
it was on floating docks?

616
00:44:44,607 --> 00:44:45,672
O-On the water?

617
00:44:45,674 --> 00:44:48,208
It's been there for 40 years.

618
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:51,210
No matter how high the water
rises, it'll rise with it.

619
00:44:51,212 --> 00:44:54,581
Plus they're likely to have
a radio and weaponry

620
00:44:54,583 --> 00:44:56,817
if we have to face
that thing again.

621
00:44:56,819 --> 00:45:00,186
That place is a ruin.
You people can't go there!

622
00:45:00,188 --> 00:45:01,757
Let's go!

623
00:45:06,261 --> 00:45:07,996
James?

624
00:45:09,297 --> 00:45:11,130
I'm going with them.

625
00:45:11,132 --> 00:45:12,734
James?

626
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:27,683
I'll go where you go.

627
00:46:01,016 --> 00:46:02,918
Look for a radio.

628
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:07,186
This is supposed to be
safer than being outside?

629
00:46:07,188 --> 00:46:11,090
This is the safest place
we can be to weather the storm.

630
00:46:11,092 --> 00:46:13,529
Settle. We could
be here for hours.

631
00:46:23,471 --> 00:46:24,704
All right.

632
00:46:24,706 --> 00:46:25,975
See if you can find anything.

633
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:30,277
The depression's
transitioning into a cyclone.

634
00:46:30,279 --> 00:46:34,146
Don't worry. This lab's
been here for 40 years.

635
00:46:34,148 --> 00:46:37,051
When the water rises,
we'll rise with it.

636
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,554
It's safe. Don't worry.

637
00:46:40,556 --> 00:46:46,295
Safe? This looks
like something unsafe!

638
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:50,199
That's blood!

639
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:52,935
Unsafe blood!

640
00:46:54,034 --> 00:46:57,038
We don't have
any other options.

641
00:47:09,384 --> 00:47:10,652
I'm sorry.

642
00:47:16,857 --> 00:47:19,327
I should never
have brought us here.

643
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,936
The Darknet
is a bunch of hoca-pocus!

644
00:47:29,938 --> 00:47:32,005
It's bogus-hogus-nogus!

645
00:47:32,007 --> 00:47:35,074
There's no sense
staying in this...

646
00:47:35,076 --> 00:47:39,078
"It's been here for 40 years.
It'll rise." What the hell...

647
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,514
It's hocus-pocus!

648
00:47:41,516 --> 00:47:44,753
This thing's gonna crumble
before our very eyes!

649
00:47:46,721 --> 00:47:49,755
Oh, I can't do this.

650
00:47:49,757 --> 00:47:50,889
I can't. Baby.

651
00:47:50,891 --> 00:47:52,291
- Baby.
- Help me, honey.

652
00:47:52,293 --> 00:47:53,893
I'm freaking out here.
I'm freaking out!

653
00:47:53,895 --> 00:47:55,061
I'm freaking out.
I can't do this!

654
00:47:55,063 --> 00:47:56,529
It will rise with us, okay?

655
00:47:56,531 --> 00:47:57,963
It's been here for 40 years.

656
00:47:57,965 --> 00:48:01,601
It'll rise with us. I promise!
You even said so.

657
00:48:01,603 --> 00:48:04,371
You're a smart guy, okay?
You're the smartest guy I know.

658
00:48:04,373 --> 00:48:05,771
I'm a smart guy?

659
00:48:05,773 --> 00:48:07,239
You're the smartest guy
I know. Okay?

660
00:48:07,241 --> 00:48:09,942
I'm a smart guy?

661
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,085
- We got this!
- We got this!

662
00:48:19,087 --> 00:48:20,420
- We got this!
- We got this!

663
00:48:20,422 --> 00:48:22,090
- We got this!
- We got this!

664
00:48:24,025 --> 00:48:26,228
Y'all need to calm down!

665
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,099
I thought hippies
were calm people.

666
00:48:34,101 --> 00:48:36,235
That thing
had more than one head.

667
00:48:36,237 --> 00:48:38,438
This has gotta be
where it came from.

668
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,309
This is its pater familiar!

669
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,651
It's gonna be okay!

670
00:48:55,723 --> 00:48:57,389
Oh, please work. Please work.

671
00:48:57,391 --> 00:49:00,125
Please, please, please, please,
please, please work.

672
00:49:00,127 --> 00:49:01,295
Please work.

673
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:05,701
Come on!

674
00:49:07,603 --> 00:49:09,735
Mayday! Mayday!

675
00:49:09,737 --> 00:49:11,706
This is William Nix
of the <i>Sweet Waters.</i>

676
00:49:12,706 --> 00:49:14,873
We are stranded
on the Isla Corazon.

677
00:49:14,875 --> 00:49:18,013
There's a storm coming,
and we are being hunted...

678
00:49:19,214 --> 00:49:21,813
We're being hunted
by a six-headed shark.

679
00:49:21,815 --> 00:49:23,683
- <i>Seis...</i>
- This is...

680
00:49:23,685 --> 00:49:26,619
<i>cabeza de tiburón.</i>

681
00:49:26,621 --> 00:49:29,554
I'm not joking. Mayday!

682
00:49:29,556 --> 00:49:31,694
Can anybody copy? Over.

683
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:34,362
Aw, this is pointless.

684
00:49:54,382 --> 00:49:55,547
Will?

685
00:49:55,549 --> 00:49:57,185
Yeah?

686
00:49:58,753 --> 00:50:01,123
Can I ask you a question?

687
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:04,993
Sure.

688
00:50:06,027 --> 00:50:08,464
Did you know
the storm was coming?

689
00:50:12,034 --> 00:50:13,666
Yeah, I heard
something about the weather.

690
00:50:13,668 --> 00:50:16,501
It was only meant to be a couple
of raindrops. That's it.

691
00:50:16,503 --> 00:50:17,505
So you knew.

692
00:50:19,074 --> 00:50:21,306
Yeah.

693
00:50:21,308 --> 00:50:23,876
I thought I could use it
and force us to work together.

694
00:50:23,878 --> 00:50:26,748
I don't... I don't know.
I was wrong.

695
00:50:27,982 --> 00:50:29,282
You know they're serious

696
00:50:29,284 --> 00:50:31,186
about suing you
and sending you to prison?

697
00:50:32,253 --> 00:50:34,857
I'm still gonna try
and save them.

698
00:50:39,728 --> 00:50:41,430
Are you gonna save us?

699
00:50:42,897 --> 00:50:45,366
Yeah. I'm gonna save us.

700
00:50:51,471 --> 00:50:55,176
Mary, I found something.

701
00:51:00,882 --> 00:51:03,952
You should see it. Come on.

702
00:51:19,132 --> 00:51:21,270
That shark was born here.

703
00:51:22,103 --> 00:51:24,637
You see those bays outside?

704
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:25,938
That's where they birthed them.

705
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:27,973
See? I told you.

706
00:51:27,975 --> 00:51:30,442
This is
the monster's birthplace.

707
00:51:30,444 --> 00:51:32,513
But why?

708
00:51:33,781 --> 00:51:35,480
Because sharks
have an amazing ability

709
00:51:35,482 --> 00:51:38,351
to repair themselves,
regenerate, really.

710
00:51:38,353 --> 00:51:40,186
Seems like they were taking
some of that ability

711
00:51:40,188 --> 00:51:42,054
of the shark to regenerate

712
00:51:42,056 --> 00:51:45,724
and trying to impart it
into humans.

713
00:51:45,726 --> 00:51:49,628
You know, sharks have been known
to live for 400-plus years.

714
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:51,463
Look here.

715
00:51:51,465 --> 00:51:53,965
If you damage
this thing badly enough,

716
00:51:53,967 --> 00:51:57,103
but you don't kill it,
it regenerates,

717
00:51:57,105 --> 00:51:59,438
but instead
of just repairing itself...

718
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,641
It grows a new head.

719
00:52:02,643 --> 00:52:04,376
Exactly.

720
00:52:04,378 --> 00:52:08,346
And this thing has been
injured five times severely.

721
00:52:08,348 --> 00:52:10,315
That means
what we're dealing with

722
00:52:10,317 --> 00:52:13,585
is six interdependent
great white sharks.

723
00:52:13,587 --> 00:52:18,190
That grow its heads back
every time you chop it off.

724
00:52:18,192 --> 00:52:19,458
So how do we kill it?

725
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:23,061
We have to go
for the heart space.

726
00:52:23,063 --> 00:52:25,197
We have to kill its chi.

727
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:28,335
Are you guys seriously
talking about killing it?

728
00:52:28,337 --> 00:52:30,837
Did you guys not hear
Captain Science over there?

729
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:33,271
He said it regenerates.

730
00:52:33,273 --> 00:52:36,608
What if it regenerates
its heart?

731
00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:38,043
One soul, one heart, man.

732
00:52:38,045 --> 00:52:40,147
That's the way
the universe works.

733
00:52:41,214 --> 00:52:44,183
No, we need
to get out of here now.

734
00:52:44,185 --> 00:52:46,518
We need to stay here.
It's not safe outside.

735
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:49,454
That thing has six heads.
We have eight heads.

736
00:52:49,456 --> 00:52:50,956
We can outsmart it.

737
00:52:50,958 --> 00:52:52,759
Is that your reasoning?

738
00:52:52,761 --> 00:52:55,594
- Oh, yes.
- That is so dumb!

739
00:52:55,596 --> 00:52:57,931
Oh, yeah?

740
00:52:57,933 --> 00:52:59,898
There's a tropical
depression outside.

741
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:01,433
We need to stay inside here.

742
00:53:01,435 --> 00:53:03,003
It's gonna turn into
a tropical cyclone.

743
00:53:03,005 --> 00:53:05,570
Water is better
than being murdered by a shark!

744
00:53:05,572 --> 00:53:09,342
I don't like killing animals,
But that thing needs to die!

745
00:53:09,344 --> 00:53:11,179
Guys.

746
00:53:31,766 --> 00:53:33,135
Oh, my God.

747
00:53:34,935 --> 00:53:36,201
Jake! Jake!

748
00:53:36,203 --> 00:53:39,237
Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake!

749
00:53:39,239 --> 00:53:40,973
Can you hear me?! Jake!

750
00:53:43,478 --> 00:53:44,579
Where did he go?!

751
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:47,683
Where'd he go?

752
00:53:50,951 --> 00:53:53,554
- Get him!
- Get him out of there!

753
00:54:03,697 --> 00:54:05,264
Please don't leave me!

754
00:54:05,266 --> 00:54:07,735
Don't leave me!

755
00:54:09,938 --> 00:54:11,337
I'm so sorry.

756
00:54:11,339 --> 00:54:14,273
I always yell at you.
I'm sorry, baby.

757
00:54:14,275 --> 00:54:15,875
I'll never yell at you again.

758
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:20,014
No, no, no. I'm sorry, baby.
I've been such an idiot.

759
00:54:35,529 --> 00:54:36,929
No, damn it!

760
00:54:49,643 --> 00:54:50,645
Go!

761
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:52,945
Get to the island!

762
00:54:52,947 --> 00:54:54,679
I'll hold it here
as long as I can!

763
00:54:54,681 --> 00:54:55,683
Go! Go! Go!

764
00:54:58,052 --> 00:54:59,421
Go!

765
00:55:04,958 --> 00:55:06,558
Come on!

766
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,196
Let's go!

767
00:55:09,797 --> 00:55:12,067
Aaah!

768
00:55:15,402 --> 00:55:18,572
SUZANNE, ON RADIO: Will! Will!
Can you hear me? Are you there?

769
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:22,643
Will, come in!
It's Suzanne! Will!

770
00:55:34,721 --> 00:55:35,855
Hello?

771
00:55:35,857 --> 00:55:37,456
Hello? Can you hear me?

772
00:55:37,458 --> 00:55:39,726
Will! Oh, my God.
Will, is that you?

773
00:55:39,728 --> 00:55:41,427
Yeah! Suzanna.

774
00:55:41,429 --> 00:55:43,630
I'm in the old lab
on the west side of the island.

775
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:46,065
Okay, stay there.
We're coming to get you.

776
00:55:46,067 --> 00:55:47,398
No, no, no, no.
Don't come here.

777
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,335
You go to the lighthouse.
You know where it is?

778
00:55:49,337 --> 00:55:51,337
Yeah, we know where it is,
but are you sure?

779
00:55:51,339 --> 00:55:53,271
The water's
pretty harsh out there.

780
00:55:53,273 --> 00:55:56,342
Yeah.
Yeah, go to the lighthouse.

781
00:55:56,344 --> 00:55:58,944
Will, did you say something
about a shark with...

782
00:55:58,946 --> 00:56:01,813
Yeah, six heads. I know.

783
00:56:01,815 --> 00:56:03,748
It sounds crazy, right?

784
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:06,485
But it's true,
and it's on the hunt.

785
00:56:06,487 --> 00:56:08,420
It's already killed five of us.

786
00:56:08,422 --> 00:56:10,825
My God. Are you safe?

787
00:56:12,927 --> 00:56:14,326
Yeah, sure.

788
00:56:14,328 --> 00:56:17,161
William, be honest with me.

789
00:56:17,163 --> 00:56:18,797
Yeah, I'll be good.

790
00:56:19,933 --> 00:56:21,666
What was that sound?

791
00:56:21,668 --> 00:56:23,536
Nothing.
Just go to the lighthouse.

792
00:56:23,538 --> 00:56:25,273
The party's waiting there
for you, okay?

793
00:56:29,777 --> 00:56:33,346
Hey, hey, Suzanne,
you listen to me carefully now.

794
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:35,382
I want you to know...

795
00:56:37,051 --> 00:56:39,851
all of this was my fault.

796
00:56:39,853 --> 00:56:42,554
You tried. I know you did.

797
00:56:42,556 --> 00:56:45,056
And I want you to know
that I don't blame you

798
00:56:45,058 --> 00:56:47,862
for anything that happened
in this relationship, okay?

799
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:52,167
I still love you.

800
00:56:54,067 --> 00:56:55,536
I'll see you soon.

801
00:56:57,071 --> 00:56:59,406
Yeah, I'll see you soon.

802
00:57:10,384 --> 00:57:11,516
"I still love you"?

803
00:57:11,518 --> 00:57:13,686
Zach, just go.

804
00:57:13,688 --> 00:57:15,390
This is insane.

805
00:57:30,503 --> 00:57:32,339
There's the lighthouse!

806
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:35,507
We have to wait for William!

807
00:57:35,509 --> 00:57:38,779
No time! We gotta go!

808
00:57:41,147 --> 00:57:42,683
Come on, Mary!

809
00:58:17,784 --> 00:58:20,820
Hey, you can. Look.
We're almost there. Mary!

810
00:58:20,822 --> 00:58:21,820
Mary!

811
00:58:21,822 --> 00:58:22,924
Come on!

812
00:59:25,185 --> 00:59:26,388
Kip.

813
00:59:27,388 --> 00:59:30,025
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

814
00:59:31,257 --> 00:59:33,794
If we get out of this...

815
00:59:35,563 --> 00:59:37,499
I want to split up.

816
00:59:45,072 --> 00:59:46,708
I do, too.

817
00:59:48,810 --> 00:59:49,978
You do?

818
00:59:55,181 --> 00:59:57,014
Come on.

819
00:59:59,753 --> 01:00:01,320
Yeah.

820
01:00:01,322 --> 01:00:03,792
I mean,
this marriage is an idea.

821
01:00:04,792 --> 01:00:06,594
Doesn't mean anything, right?

822
01:00:08,163 --> 01:00:09,531
Well...

823
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:16,804
it does, if you want it
to mean something.

824
01:00:31,351 --> 01:00:33,319
It does.

825
01:00:56,877 --> 01:00:57,878
Oh, my God!

826
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,728
Let's run! Run!

827
01:01:51,431 --> 01:01:53,033
To the lighthouse!

828
01:02:01,342 --> 01:02:03,778
No, I can't. I can't.

829
01:02:25,866 --> 01:02:27,465
I'm done.

830
01:02:27,467 --> 01:02:28,534
Let's go! Let's go!

831
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:29,800
- No!
- Let's go!

832
01:02:29,802 --> 01:02:30,835
- No!
- We have to go!

833
01:02:30,837 --> 01:02:32,603
- No!
- Daphne, we have to go.

834
01:02:32,605 --> 01:02:35,241
- Please, Daphne, let's go.
- No.

835
01:02:35,243 --> 01:02:37,978
James! James!

836
01:02:44,317 --> 01:02:50,255
Yaaaaah!

837
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:57,831
Aaaaaah!

838
01:03:35,036 --> 01:03:37,105
Get 'em to the lighthouse.

839
01:03:50,851 --> 01:03:53,050
Visibility out here's
impossible, Suze.

840
01:03:53,052 --> 01:03:54,585
Even with
all this instrumentation,

841
01:03:54,587 --> 01:03:55,853
we can still run aground.

842
01:03:55,855 --> 01:03:57,758
We don't have a choice!

843
01:03:58,592 --> 01:04:00,728
We got lucky, babe.

844
01:04:11,871 --> 01:04:14,440
Here.
We'll get her down here.

845
01:04:14,442 --> 01:04:16,744
Here. I got this.

846
01:04:18,145 --> 01:04:19,347
Here.

847
01:04:22,348 --> 01:04:23,748
We need to find power.

848
01:04:23,750 --> 01:04:25,884
We need to find the fuse box.

849
01:04:25,886 --> 01:04:28,288
No, dude, down here.

850
01:04:30,523 --> 01:04:31,590
You gonna be okay?

851
01:04:31,592 --> 01:04:33,558
I got this.

852
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:34,995
- Will!
- I'm coming!

853
01:04:39,565 --> 01:04:41,833
Duke?

854
01:04:41,835 --> 01:04:43,369
Duke, you don't have to...

855
01:04:43,371 --> 01:04:46,438
Relax. Daphne.

856
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:48,072
Daphne.

857
01:04:48,074 --> 01:04:51,712
You can have
that purple El Camino.

858
01:04:53,313 --> 01:04:55,782
I love you.

859
01:04:56,616 --> 01:04:58,819
I'm so glad you know it.

860
01:05:01,121 --> 01:05:02,323
So glad.

861
01:05:41,494 --> 01:05:42,763
Duke?

862
01:05:43,663 --> 01:05:45,132
Duke?!

863
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:48,802
Duke?!

864
01:06:13,427 --> 01:06:14,429
Here it is.

865
01:06:23,237 --> 01:06:25,740
I know what's going on
with you and Mary.

866
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:28,105
Whatever you think
is happening,

867
01:06:28,107 --> 01:06:30,444
- it is not...
- Is happening!

868
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:44,092
You know...

869
01:06:45,393 --> 01:06:47,395
you shouldn't lie to me.

870
01:06:48,895 --> 01:06:50,864
I'm smarter than you.

871
01:07:00,208 --> 01:07:02,574
There's nothing
going on between me...

872
01:07:02,576 --> 01:07:04,076
How old is this lighthouse?

873
01:07:04,078 --> 01:07:06,447
- Why?
- Found a whole case of these.

874
01:07:08,214 --> 01:07:10,849
- Acetylene.
- Yeah. They used it to burn the lights.

875
01:07:10,851 --> 01:07:12,550
We still need
to turn the lighthouse on.

876
01:07:12,552 --> 01:07:14,119
I'll turn the light on.

877
01:07:14,121 --> 01:07:15,956
You bring the acetylene.

878
01:07:19,759 --> 01:07:21,226
Mary?

879
01:07:21,228 --> 01:07:24,232
There's too many of these
for one person to carry.

880
01:07:32,706 --> 01:07:34,208
Let's go.

881
01:08:38,105 --> 01:08:40,270
There it is!
There's the lighthouse!

882
01:08:40,272 --> 01:08:42,841
Okay, bring us around slow,
close enough to the beach

883
01:08:42,843 --> 01:08:44,846
- without running us aground.
- Okay.

884
01:09:07,535 --> 01:09:09,904
Guys, a boat!

885
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:25,453
What's that
heading towards the boat?

886
01:09:29,757 --> 01:09:31,025
What is that?

887
01:09:33,459 --> 01:09:34,462
Shark!

888
01:09:35,795 --> 01:09:37,164
It's circling.

889
01:09:42,936 --> 01:09:44,938
Zach?

890
01:09:53,847 --> 01:09:55,779
It's dragging us down!

891
01:09:55,781 --> 01:09:57,317
Not if I can pull us up!

892
01:09:58,384 --> 01:09:59,920
What?

893
01:10:03,789 --> 01:10:05,424
Get out of the way!

894
01:10:05,426 --> 01:10:07,792
Give me the shells!

895
01:10:07,794 --> 01:10:09,894
No! No, you'll hit her!

896
01:10:09,896 --> 01:10:11,930
One shot, one kill!

897
01:10:11,932 --> 01:10:13,899
I hit everything
I'm shooting at!

898
01:10:13,901 --> 01:10:16,003
Not on my watch, you don't!

899
01:10:26,946 --> 01:10:28,148
Mary.

900
01:10:41,661 --> 01:10:42,993
Save yourself!

901
01:10:42,995 --> 01:10:45,298
- Zach!
- Go!

902
01:11:42,556 --> 01:11:45,793
No! No!

903
01:11:47,828 --> 01:11:50,130
No, no! No!

904
01:11:51,364 --> 01:11:52,532
No.

905
01:11:55,567 --> 01:11:57,070
No.

906
01:12:01,909 --> 01:12:04,545
No. No, no, no.

907
01:12:16,190 --> 01:12:18,526
No, no. No. No.

908
01:12:24,030 --> 01:12:26,499
We have to get
away from the water.

909
01:12:31,704 --> 01:12:34,741
Where did you find
the acetylene canisters?

910
01:12:42,749 --> 01:12:45,252
I need to lure the shark
out of the water.

911
01:12:47,187 --> 01:12:50,287
You shoot the cylinders.

912
01:12:50,289 --> 01:12:52,426
And make it count.

913
01:12:53,526 --> 01:12:55,195
I will.

914
01:13:30,062 --> 01:13:32,096
We're gonna
get out of this.

915
01:13:32,098 --> 01:13:34,064
You are. I'll make sure of it.

916
01:13:34,066 --> 01:13:35,766
So are you.

917
01:13:35,768 --> 01:13:36,868
What's the point?

918
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:39,770
I relish the idea
of spending time in prison.

919
01:13:39,772 --> 01:13:42,073
That's not gonna happen.
I'll represent you,

920
01:13:42,075 --> 01:13:43,640
but you might lose
everything else.

921
01:13:43,642 --> 01:13:46,411
I've already lost everything.

922
01:13:46,413 --> 01:13:48,781
Then I'll help you
with that, too.

923
01:13:59,959 --> 01:14:01,993
Spread out.

924
01:14:01,995 --> 01:14:04,095
Stay parallel with me.

925
01:14:04,097 --> 01:14:06,167
Confuse the shark
on who to attack.

926
01:14:11,103 --> 01:14:13,840
Come on!
I'm over here!

927
01:14:14,840 --> 01:14:16,041
Come on!

928
01:14:16,043 --> 01:14:17,844
Come on, come on,
let's get out of here.

929
01:14:24,284 --> 01:14:27,752
Come on. Come on.

930
01:14:30,289 --> 01:14:31,590
What are you doing?!

931
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:34,326
Wait for the shark
to be over the canisters!

932
01:14:34,328 --> 01:14:36,230
Don't shoot yet!

933
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:41,936
Come on, you ugly bastard!

934
01:14:44,437 --> 01:14:46,873
Come on!
Is that all you got?

935
01:14:47,874 --> 01:14:51,109
Come on! 1, 2, 3!

936
01:14:51,111 --> 01:14:53,547
Show me what you got!
Come on!

937
01:14:55,347 --> 01:14:57,715
Ah! I'm over here!

938
01:14:57,717 --> 01:14:59,286
Come on!

939
01:15:01,687 --> 01:15:03,822
I'm over here!
Come on!

940
01:15:03,824 --> 01:15:05,223
No, come on!

941
01:15:05,225 --> 01:15:07,058
Come on...

942
01:15:07,060 --> 01:15:09,961
Come on...
I'm here!

943
01:15:09,963 --> 01:15:11,764
Come on! Kill me!

944
01:16:23,504 --> 01:16:25,537
The boat, it's free
from the rocks.

945
01:16:25,539 --> 01:16:28,075
I'll get the canisters.

946
01:16:32,178 --> 01:16:33,579
Get on the boat.

947
01:16:34,481 --> 01:16:35,883
Let's go, let's go.

948
01:17:21,861 --> 01:17:22,863
Damn it.

949
01:17:25,130 --> 01:17:26,834
She's not starting.

950
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:35,441
What?!

951
01:18:35,201 --> 01:18:37,969
The motor's busted,
but the hull's not too bad.

952
01:18:37,971 --> 01:18:40,371
We can sail out of here,
but I need your help.

953
01:18:40,373 --> 01:18:42,609
- Okay.
- Okay.

954
01:18:51,517 --> 01:18:53,020
It's coming back.

955
01:19:02,294 --> 01:19:04,864
Unh! Aaah!

956
01:19:05,699 --> 01:19:07,232
All right. Come on.

957
01:19:07,234 --> 01:19:08,936
I got... got you.

958
01:19:36,163 --> 01:19:37,498
Stay here!

959
01:19:50,576 --> 01:19:51,777
Come on!

960
01:20:17,503 --> 01:20:19,673
Die!

961
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:26,344
Die! Come on! Just die!

962
01:20:26,346 --> 01:20:29,215
- We have to get out of here!
- You get out of here!

963
01:20:37,123 --> 01:20:38,926
I'm not gonna leave you here!

964
01:20:39,725 --> 01:20:42,025
Go!

965
01:20:42,027 --> 01:20:43,493
Go!

966
01:20:43,495 --> 01:20:45,298
I'm not gonna leave you here!

967
01:20:49,002 --> 01:20:50,603
Go!

968
01:20:51,570 --> 01:20:52,772
Go, go!

969
01:21:04,418 --> 01:21:08,088
Die, you son of a bitch!

970
01:21:15,562 --> 01:21:18,930
Go now! We gotta go!
We gotta go!

971
01:21:18,932 --> 01:21:20,133
Go! Go!

972
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:10,881
It's still coming!
We gotta go! Go, go!

973
01:22:10,883 --> 01:22:13,184
We gotta get out of here!
Go!

974
01:22:13,186 --> 01:22:14,321
Okay, go!

975
01:22:30,704 --> 01:22:34,907
Come on. Go!

976
01:22:38,178 --> 01:22:40,013
We gotta go...

977
01:22:44,351 --> 01:22:45,819
Go! Go, go!

978
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:49,281
Aaaaah!

979
01:25:30,587 --> 01:25:35,587
