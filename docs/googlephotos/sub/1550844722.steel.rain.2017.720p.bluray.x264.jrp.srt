22

What was the start of
20th century Korea?

118
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:41,933
- The Japan-Korea Treaty of 1910.
- Yes.

119
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:46,647
But we call it
the National humiliation year.

120
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:53,695
The 36 years of Japanese rule
ended in 1945.

121
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,823
But let's point out something here.

122
00:10:56,907 --> 00:11:00,035
Germany, which started
the war in Europe,

123
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,162
was divided into East and West.

124
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:09,211
But in Asia,
Korea got cut in half, not Japan.

125
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:10,629
Did we start the war?

126
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,257
We couldn't get independence
on our own.

127
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:16,592
Right.

128
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:17,803
Then what happened?

129
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:19,721
- The Korean War.
- Yes.

130
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:25,811
The first Cold War proxy war
broke out on our land.

131
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:32,025
Our people were taken away
to slavery and wars, then died.

132
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:35,654
Including the comfort women,
3 million people died.

133
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:39,199
Another 3 million died
in the Korean War.

134
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:42,577
20 to 25% of the population
were killed.

135
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:46,623
It means
1 out of 4 or 5 of you died.

136
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:52,587
In the 20th century, our ideology
was based on Japan.

137
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,047
So what did we do?

138
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,341
We followed Japan
in Japanese style.

139
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:57,425
The result?

140
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:00,595
Samsung beats Sony
and Hyundai outsells Honda.

141
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:04,599
That's how we took action against
this ideology called Japan.

142
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:08,812
Then what about North Korea?

143
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:11,648
How was Japan defeated?

144
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:12,899
Nuclear bombs.

145
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,900
Nukes!

146
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:16,027
Nuclear weapons!

147
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:20,656
North Korea will be defeated
with nukes just like Japan!

148
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:21,491
What?

149
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:25,579
What kind of bullshit is that?
Huh?

150
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:27,080
I'm right, aren't I?

151
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:29,957
Nukes can only be stopped
by nukes!

152
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,961
Everyone knows that!

153
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:35,380
Think about it.

154
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:39,634
<i>Professor JUNG Se-Yong

If we have nukes,
it won't be this complicated.

155
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:42,845
Or have the nuclear option
like the Japanese.

156
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:46,682
If not that,
declare to review having nukes.

157
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,810

00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,315
The Chinese and Russians
listen to his music too.

180
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,567
Why you!

181
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,236
You want to ruin your life?

182
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,948
Listening to South Korean music
could have us killed!

183
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,158
Say you won't listen to it.

184
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:31,705
I said the Chinese and Russians
listen to it, not me.

185
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,999
I won't listen to it.

186
00:14:42,883 --> 00:14:43,967
Hurry up and eat.

187
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:27,928
What is this?

188
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,347
I've received a mission again.

189
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,767
You'll be sent to
the embassy in Cuba.

190
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:35,352
Take this money.

191
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:39,981
Cuba? What do you mean?

192
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:44,861
It's a hard opportunity to get.
Go ahead without me.

193
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:51,868
I'm not sure what this is,
but I'm not going until you return.

I'll join you later.
Take In-young and go first.

197
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,562

199
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:27,028
Have a safe trip.

200
00:16:36,287 --> 00:16:38,039
It's cold, dear.

201
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:44,170

293
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:13,877
An MLRS from the US Army
2nd Division went missing at dawn.

294
00:29:13,878 --> 00:29:17,757
The seized MLRS just fired
2 Steel Rain bombs at Kaesong.

00:29:24,305 --> 00:29:27,433
Bodies found at the scene
were in our military attire,

298
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:31,144

We'll investigate, but...

299
00:29:31,145 --> 00:29:32,145

300
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:33,188

Excuse me.

303
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:44,575
- It's urgent.
- What is it?

304
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:51,665
Chinese Foreign Ministry requested
entry for their people from Kaesong.

305
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:53,834
- It's an emergency.
- Let them in.

306
00:29:55,169 --> 00:29:56,504

307
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:26,033

Our Leader was killed
in the Kaesong bombing!

311
00:31:35,895 --> 00:31:39,148
The civil war here
should be dealt with first.

312
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:43,819
The nuclear weapons
and Pyongyang...

313
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:46,405
I have full command of them.

314
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:48,908
Is China with me or not?

315
00:31:59,043 --> 00:32:03,964
How could you leak it to the press
without consulting us first?

316
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:09,595

U.S military weapons were used here,

00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,782
to launch an attack

322
00:32:29,907 --> 00:32:32,534
That puts us in the cross hairs.

323
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:34,328
We needed to clear our name.

324

Now,

325
00:32:37,957 --> 00:32:41,877
we're convinced that a coup

326
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:48,008
I've managed to quiet
the press for a while, but

327
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:54,598

353
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:50,881
Your blood is going into

354
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:58,263
I hope it's good enough
for our Great General.

00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:28,210

357
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:31,797
PARK didn't come,
but our Leader did.

358
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,133
Then we got attacked.

359
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:36,260

361
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,014
Il-San, sir.

362
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,809
<i>Il-San? In the South?</i>

363
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:44,934
Yes, sir.

364
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:50,607
I'm with the Great General.

365
00:35:52,234 --> 00:35:54,319
How is his status?

366
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:58,115
<i>He's alive, but critical.</i>

367
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:01,410
Listen carefully.

368
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:04,288
<i>We must bring back
his corpse at least.</i>

369
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:09,334
<i>When PARK realizes he is dead,
the coup will be successful.</i>

370
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:15,007
Stay there and protect him.
I'll send people soon.

371
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,216
Yes, sir.

372
00:36:24,433 --> 00:36:28,187
These tanks are from
Sariwon 815 Mechanized Corps.

373
00:36:28,604 --> 00:36:33,108
These are from the 820 Armored Corps
of Pyongyang Defense Command.

374
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:37,738
The 815 tanks retreated back
after the battle.

375
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:43,327
The 820 Armored Corps remain
defending Pyongyang to the south.

376
00:36:44,995 --> 00:36:46,205
It's a coup, sir.

377
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:49,541
Find out who's behind it
and if it succeeded or not.

378
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:50,708
Yes, sir.

379
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:51,834
Sir?

380
00:36:52,169 --> 00:36:53,670
It's not confirmed yet,

381
00:36:53,921 --> 00:36:55,339
but during the bombing

382
00:36:55,464 --> 00:36:57,716
North Korea's No. 1
may have died.

383
00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:00,343
- And...
- And what?

384
00:37:00,344 --> 00:37:01,344
Wait.

385
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:02,762
North Korea may declare war.

386
00:37:02,763 --> 00:37:04,014
What!

387
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:06,265
Though we're in transition,

388
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:11,396
a secretary can't barge into
a ministerial meeting like this!

389
00:37:11,772 --> 00:37:13,232
Who's your source of intelligence?

390
00:37:14,024 --> 00:37:19,279
The CIA and
the Chinese State Security, sir.

391
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:25,911
I did what I could.

392
00:37:28,372 --> 00:37:32,417
He got shot
in the head, shoulder, and thigh.

393
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:36,338
I patched the hole
in his shoulder.

394
00:37:37,089 --> 00:37:38,423
I took out the one

395
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,678
in the thigh.

396
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:48,433
There's femoral artery rupture,
but I could only bandage it.

397
00:37:49,977 --> 00:37:53,897
The biggest problem
is the one in the cranial cavity.

398
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:56,608
But I can't do it.

399
00:37:57,526 --> 00:37:59,027
Why not?
You're a doctor.

400
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:07,327
I'm not a neurosurgeon.

401
00:38:08,245 --> 00:38:11,290
Unless it's a baby inside here,

402
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:17,087
there's nothing I can do.

403
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:23,218
My people are coming.
Please treat him till then.

404
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:30,225
North Korea's...

405
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:34,229
President is here!

406
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:37,357
I mean... Geeze!

407
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:40,944
What are you doing in the dark?

408
00:38:41,278 --> 00:38:44,406
Looking for some food.

409
00:38:46,283 --> 00:38:48,368
You keep food here?

410
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,746
Yes, it's up here.

411
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:53,290
It's hot.

412
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:54,373
Here. Try it.

413
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:58,295
Isn't this yi-bap?

414
00:38:58,337 --> 00:38:59,921
What?

415
00:39:00,297 --> 00:39:02,257
This is yi-bap.

416
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,468
You know, rice.

417
00:39:05,344 --> 00:39:07,471
Right.

418
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:09,389
It's white rice.

419
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:14,436
Can we eat this black thing?

420
00:39:16,605 --> 00:39:19,857
It's really good!

421
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:21,276
It's meat!

422
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:30,369
After getting paid today,
I was going to exchange it for food.

423
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:38,043
There's no food at home.
My family must be starving.

424
00:39:40,337 --> 00:39:41,421
LYEO Min-KYUNG!

425
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:45,092
They'll be resting comfortably
at home.

426
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:46,676
They should worry about you.

427
00:39:47,803 --> 00:39:49,137
Eat up.

428
00:39:49,346 --> 00:39:52,849
We have to protect
our Great General, right?

429
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:01,482
Eat.

430
00:40:01,942 --> 00:40:04,319
And stop crying.

431
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:11,493
Try the black stuff.
It's sweet and yummy.

432
00:40:14,538 --> 00:40:18,542
She made it so easily too.

433
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:21,670
- Stay inside the room.
- Yes, sir.

434
00:40:22,504 --> 00:40:23,504
Let's go.

435
00:40:44,568 --> 00:40:46,153
Where's our Leader?

436
00:42:42,102 --> 00:42:43,102
Drop the gun.

437
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:37,656
Move.

438
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:10,439
Hold tight!

439
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:30,794
Su-mi! Look!

440
00:44:30,835 --> 00:44:33,630
The General is bleeding!

441
00:44:36,675 --> 00:44:39,719
I think it's my blood.

442
00:44:41,388 --> 00:44:42,389
Su-mi!

443
00:44:44,057 --> 00:44:45,809
Lay her down, quickly!

444
00:44:49,562 --> 00:44:50,562
Su-mi!

445
00:44:53,525 --> 00:44:54,609
No!

446
00:44:55,068 --> 00:44:57,278
You have to focus!

447
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,780
Press down hard.

448
00:45:01,616 --> 00:45:02,742
She has to get surgery.

449
00:45:02,826 --> 00:45:05,328
She lost too much blood!

450
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:08,456
- Su-mi! Wake up!
- There's no time!

451
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:09,915
We can't.

452
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:12,544
Find a place
to treat her in secret.

453
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:16,631
Please save Su-mi.

454
00:45:18,967 --> 00:45:22,679
Su-mi! Wake up!

455
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:30,854
Su-hyeon? I need your help.

456
00:45:46,745 --> 00:45:48,204
This way! Hurry!

457
00:45:53,168 --> 00:45:54,794
- Sook-Jung?
- This way!

458
00:45:54,878 --> 00:45:56,421
What's going on?

459
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:59,340
Take them to the emergency!
I'm a plastic surgeon!

460
00:45:59,424 --> 00:46:02,135
I'm a gynecologist!
At least you're a surgeon.

461
00:46:02,218 --> 00:46:02,886
Move.

462
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:05,513
Go in here. This way!

463
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:08,682
Hey!

464
00:46:13,188 --> 00:46:15,190
What's going on?

465
00:46:19,778 --> 00:46:21,738
Help us.
I won't hurt you.

466
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:25,700
Please Su-hyeon...

467
00:46:26,242 --> 00:46:28,870
First, let's save them.
Let's save her first.

468
00:46:54,896 --> 00:46:56,648
<i>NARCOTIC DRUGS</i>

469
00:47:17,377 --> 00:47:18,711
What are you doing?

470
00:47:19,796 --> 00:47:21,881
Why aren't you treating her?

471
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:24,133
Doctor!

472
00:47:29,973 --> 00:47:33,852
Su-mi! No!

473
00:47:36,646 --> 00:47:38,481
No! You can't die!

474
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:44,821
Su-mi!

475
00:47:51,286 --> 00:47:52,996
Sir!

476
00:47:54,998 --> 00:47:57,333
The report came in
from the scene at Il-San.

477
00:47:57,876 --> 00:47:58,877
I'm listening.

478
00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:04,465
Three bodies presumed to be
North Korean operatives were found.

479
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:08,845
A Chinese van full of panda dolls
from Kaesong was also there.

480
00:48:10,889 --> 00:48:12,015
North Korean operatives?

481
00:48:12,098 --> 00:48:15,642
A 911 call was made from there
20 minutes before the shootings.

482
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:16,853
About what?

483
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:19,814
Saying the North Korean president
was there.

484
00:48:19,898 --> 00:48:21,274
What? Give me that.

485
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,860
North Korea doesn't have
a president.

486
00:48:27,906 --> 00:48:31,284
KWON Sook-Jung.

487
00:48:33,286 --> 00:48:35,330
Gynecologist?

488
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:40,251
<i>NASTY WOMAN</i>

489
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:05,902
Se-rim? It's daddy.

490
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:08,738
Is your mom home?

491
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:13,868
With Aunt Sook-Jung?

492
00:49:14,202 --> 00:49:15,536
She's still at work?

493
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:18,956
It's nothing.

494
00:49:18,957 --> 00:49:21,918
Go back to bed.

495
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:33,346
I'll be at this address.
Call me an hour later.

496
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:35,640
If I don't pick up,

497
00:49:35,765 --> 00:49:37,767
send the police.
No!

498
00:49:39,686 --> 00:49:40,937
Send special forces!

499
00:49:41,604 --> 00:49:42,313
Got that?

500
00:49:42,397 --> 00:49:43,564
What? Why?

501
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:45,274
In one hour! don't forget!

502
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,400
What's going on, sir?

503
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:49,028
- Call me in an hour!
- Sir!

504
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:55,159
I heard North Korea was beyond
the river by Jayu-ro Highway.

505
00:49:55,994 --> 00:49:58,913
But I guess it didn't
really hit me.

506
00:50:00,999 --> 00:50:03,042
It's so close by...

507
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:05,503
I'm sorry.

508
00:50:07,255 --> 00:50:08,256
Su-hyeon!

509
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:10,090
Su-hyeon!

510
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:15,013
Why don't you ever
answer your phone?

511
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:21,310
What the?

512
00:50:23,396 --> 00:50:25,273
- Cheol-woo!
- It's okay, Su-hyeon.

513
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:27,859
Get all their hand phones.

514
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:29,694
I'm so sorry.

515
00:50:30,111 --> 00:50:32,863
- I'm so sorry for this.
- It's okay.

516
00:50:32,864 --> 00:50:34,824
Get things to tie them with!

517
00:50:38,036 --> 00:50:39,162
Sit!

518
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:42,205
Sit down!

519
00:50:49,505 --> 00:50:54,135
That man over there
is your No. 1, right?

520
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:57,012
A coup occurred there,
so you couldn't go back.

521
00:50:57,013 --> 00:50:59,599
You snuck in
when the Chinese came, right?

522
00:51:00,308 --> 00:51:01,434
Who are you?

523
00:51:01,768 --> 00:51:04,479
Some coincidence this is.

524
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:08,274
Maybe it's more like fate.

525
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:10,943
I'm head secretary of
National Security.

526
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:12,862
I work for the No. 1 here.

527
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:19,202
I'll help you.

528
00:51:20,078 --> 00:51:22,080
No matter how skilled you are,

529
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:24,998
what can you do
with just that one girl?

530
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:29,587
Let's say we help
your No. 1 to recover.

531
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:30,837
Then what?

532
00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:32,507
How will you take him back?

533
00:51:32,882 --> 00:51:34,300
You rotten bastard!

534
00:51:36,677 --> 00:51:42,141
The men who tried to kill
No. 1 at Il-San

535
00:51:42,225 --> 00:51:43,851
are your people.

536
00:51:44,102 --> 00:51:48,314
Our help is your best bet now.

537
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:50,691
Act wisely.

538
00:51:50,817 --> 00:51:51,943
Shut up!

539
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:57,240
North Korea will soon declare war.

540
00:52:01,786 --> 00:52:06,582
<i>We declare war against
the U.S. and South Korea!</i>

541
00:52:07,375 --> 00:52:10,962
<i>American imperialists and
South Koreans puppets</i>

542
00:52:11,212 --> 00:52:14,799
<i>dared to take aim yesterday
at our Dear Leader</i>

543
00:52:14,841 --> 00:52:18,719
<i>and top commanding officers
by bombarding Kaesong.</i>

544
00:52:18,803 --> 00:52:23,266
<i>Upon this unpardonable atrocity,
the Supreme Command</i>

545
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:27,770
<i>terminates the armistice agreement
and declares war.</i>

546
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:31,107
If they pull anything,
kill them.

547
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:38,196
<i>Once war breaks out,
our mighty army</i>

548
00:52:38,197 --> 00:52:44,370
<i>will burn down the mutts
of the U.S. and the Blue House</i>

549
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:46,788
<i>with nuclear bombs!</i>

550
00:52:46,789 --> 00:52:48,249
I'll declare martial law.
Get ready.

551
00:53:05,057 --> 00:53:06,100
How is our Leader?

552
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:10,062
If he doesn't get surgery now,
he could die.

553
00:53:10,438 --> 00:53:13,816
But why the declaration of war?

554
00:53:14,066 --> 00:53:18,154
<i>Who's in control of Pyongyang?
PARK Gwang-dong!</i>

555
00:53:18,446 --> 00:53:23,826
<i>It was the only way to stop him
from bringing in the frontline troops.</i>

556
00:53:24,452 --> 00:53:26,162
<i>This phone is tapped.</i>

557
00:53:26,495 --> 00:53:28,497
<i>We got attacked at Il-San
and almost died.</i>

558
00:53:30,249 --> 00:53:31,334
<i>I think...</i>

559
00:53:32,293 --> 00:53:34,503
we should request help
from the South.

560
00:53:34,754 --> 00:53:37,131
<i>It's the only way
to save our Leader.</i>

561
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:39,175
Comrade Cheol-woo!

562
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:40,968
<i>Watch for your phone
being tapped, sir.</i>

563
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:57,235
The declaration of war is a show.

564
00:53:57,276 --> 00:54:00,613
It's because of PARK Gwang-dong
staging the coup!

565
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:04,367
It was to stop PARK from
mobilizing the frontline troops.

566
00:54:04,492 --> 00:54:07,161
The South must not act recklessly
and just wait!

567
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:10,373
Stay still, when they declared war?
That's crazy!

568
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:13,292
Save our Leader as promised.

569
00:54:13,668 --> 00:54:16,295
Let our frontline troops
go to Pyongyang

570
00:54:16,379 --> 00:54:18,297
to stop the coup.

571
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:21,384
Convince your government
to help us.

572
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:24,887
It's the only way
to save the Korean Peninsula.

573
00:54:25,513 --> 00:54:28,766
<i>B-52 from the mainland will
deploy these missiles.</i>

574
00:54:29,183 --> 00:54:32,520
<i>Nuclear-tipped cruise missiles will strike
the Pyongyang Defense Command,</i>

575
00:54:32,728 --> 00:54:37,024
<i>as well as frontline troops,
military installations near the DMZ</i>

576
00:54:37,149 --> 00:54:39,193
<i>that are a direct threat to
South Korea.</i>

577
00:54:39,402 --> 00:54:42,238
<i>This will permanently demilitarize
the North Korean army.</i>

578
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,406
A nuclear strike on the North

579
00:54:44,407 --> 00:54:47,618
will cause immense damage
from EMP and radiation.

580
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:50,870
<i>Yes, Maybe.
Maybe there could be some damage.</i>

581
00:54:50,871 --> 00:54:54,708
<i>But a full-scale conventional war
with the North Korea will result in</i>

582
00:54:54,709 --> 00:54:57,377
<i>over three hundred thousand
casualties at best,</i>

583
00:54:57,378 --> 00:55:00,965
<i>which can easily escalate to
roughly 2. 5 million.</i>

584
00:55:01,674 --> 00:55:06,219
<i>Our simulation calculates the cost of war
at 1 trillion U.S. dollars,</i>

585
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:09,849
<i>and an additional 3 trillion
in post-war restorations.</i>

586
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:13,602
<i>And this is only in the case that
North Korea does not use nuclear weapons.</i>

587
00:55:13,853 --> 00:55:16,272
<i>If they use their
nuclear weapons, well,</i>

588
00:55:16,522 --> 00:55:18,482
<i>our simulation would be meaningless.</i>

589
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:22,110
<i>Should the ROK-U.S.
Combined Forces Command succeed,</i>

590
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:24,362
<i>we project zero casualties</i>

591
00:55:24,363 --> 00:55:29,827
<i>at a total cost of three hundred billion
dollars up to the point of full stabilization.</i>

592
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:34,497
<i>If the South Korean government agrees to cover
two hundred and 50 billion of those costs,</i>

593
00:55:34,498 --> 00:55:37,543
<i>the U.S. will compensate
the remaining 50 billion.</i>

594
00:55:37,752 --> 00:55:40,379
If it's unavoidable,
I'll agree to war.

595
00:55:41,339 --> 00:55:45,968
But it should be the last resort
after exploring all options.

596
00:55:46,385 --> 00:55:47,219
And a nuclear war is...

597
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:51,014
<i>we are merely proposing these revisions in
a response to the South Korean government's</i>

598
00:55:51,015 --> 00:55:54,143
<i>request to activate
Operation Plan 5027.</i>

599
00:56:00,274 --> 00:56:01,400
That's right.

600
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:04,612
We requested this meeting.

601
00:56:05,488 --> 00:56:09,283
I appreciate your cordial review
and suggestions.

602
00:56:09,408 --> 00:56:11,369
Without hindering the operation,

603
00:56:11,452 --> 00:56:14,246
could you tell us
how much time we have?

604
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:16,498
<i>Our simulation tells us that</i>

605
00:56:16,499 --> 00:56:19,918
<i>North Korea will require
forty-eight hours in preparation for war.</i>

606
00:56:19,919 --> 00:56:23,463
<i>B-52 will leave from
Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota.</i>

607
00:56:23,464 --> 00:56:26,966
<i>Mission time to point of target
will approximate twelve hours,</i>

608
00:56:26,967 --> 00:56:31,305
<i>which means you have at most thirty-six
hours from now to reach a decision.</i>

609
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:32,932
<i>President Lee,</i>

610
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:36,394
<i>this will all occur during
your presidential term.</i>

611
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,753
<i>North Korea's No. 1 is here.
I have him. He is unconscious.</i>

612
00:56:44,777 --> 00:56:47,655
As the President of
the Republic of Korea,

613
00:56:47,947 --> 00:56:49,990
- I order the preemptive nuclear...
- Sir!

614
00:57:08,551 --> 00:57:09,551
Sir!

615
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:12,680
These were at the scene.

616
00:57:16,392 --> 00:57:19,311
The uniform and chocolate
were found in the van.

617
00:57:19,395 --> 00:57:21,397
- Keep that separate.
- Yes, sir.

618
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:27,111
All clear.
No threat of danger.

619
00:57:29,488 --> 00:57:32,199
- Send this to digital forensics.
- Yes, sir.

620
00:57:36,662 --> 00:57:41,167
<i>Beloved citizens.
Article 77 of our Constitution...</i>

621
00:57:41,459 --> 00:57:44,378
<i>and Articles 2 and 10
of the Martial Law Act,</i>

622
00:57:44,462 --> 00:57:47,423
<i>as of 6:00 AM on December 25th,</i>

623
00:57:47,548 --> 00:57:50,468
<i>I declare the nation
under martial law.</i>

624
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:52,761
<i>Beloved citizens,</i>

625
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:56,307
<i>please go on with
your daily lives.</i>

626
00:57:56,390 --> 00:58:00,853
<i>I ask that you cooperate
with us and the militarized command.</i>

627
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,023
So?

628
00:58:05,274 --> 00:58:08,986
The polygraph shows
that he's telling the truth.

629
00:58:11,614 --> 00:58:12,614
And the girl?

630
00:58:12,698 --> 00:58:15,117
She doesn't know anything, sir.

631
00:58:17,286 --> 00:58:19,288
My, my.

632
00:58:20,331 --> 00:58:24,668
You surprised me with this one.

633
00:58:25,711 --> 00:58:29,965
You went to your wife
during a national crisis,

634
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:32,343
and captured the enemy head.

635
00:58:33,552 --> 00:58:34,845
Not bad for a substitute.

636
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:36,680
Good work.

637
00:58:37,389 --> 00:58:38,516
Amazing!

638
00:58:41,477 --> 00:58:42,478
Thank you, sir.

639
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:00,246
He can't see us, right?

640
00:59:00,621 --> 00:59:01,621
Right.

641
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:05,501
He has something to say.

642
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:06,709
To me?

643
00:59:12,258 --> 00:59:14,301
How's our Leader's condition?

644
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:17,263
I reported
that your government is helping.

645
00:59:17,346 --> 00:59:20,683
If anything happens to him,
it's all your country's fault!

646
00:59:21,267 --> 00:59:25,938
You folks started the mess!
Why is it all our fault?

647
00:59:26,647 --> 00:59:27,647
Man.

648
00:59:28,482 --> 00:59:30,818
The first round is over,
so rest up.

649
00:59:32,444 --> 00:59:33,904
If anything happens to him,

650
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:36,574
it'll be war!

651
00:59:39,034 --> 00:59:40,077
Okay!

652
00:59:46,959 --> 00:59:48,544
While you were bringing in No. 1,

653
00:59:48,669 --> 00:59:51,964
Chief Park of National Security
let out that we had No. 1.

654
00:59:52,673 --> 00:59:55,259
- They responded right away.
- Who?

655
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:58,637
North Korea will come
to check and talk.

656
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:03,559
We almost agreed to
a preemptive nuclear strike.

657
01:00:05,311 --> 01:00:09,189
The President-elect said to meet
the North Korean rep, then decide.

658
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:11,692
We stopped the war for now.

659
01:00:12,192 --> 01:00:15,112
Who's coming down?
And who's going to meet him?

660
01:00:16,322 --> 01:00:17,656
Well...

661
01:00:18,032 --> 01:00:21,660
We suggested meeting first,
but they won't give us any info.

662
01:00:23,078 --> 01:00:26,540
The Blue House insists on
sending someone.

663
01:00:28,167 --> 01:00:30,544
They want all the credit.

664
01:00:30,586 --> 01:00:33,756
Chief Park's ambitions are too high.

665
01:00:37,343 --> 01:00:38,343
Hello, sir.

666
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:45,100
What's he up to?

667
01:00:45,934 --> 01:00:48,312
- Just sleeping, sir.
- Did he eat?

668
01:00:48,729 --> 01:00:50,064
No, he won't eat.

669
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:53,650
It's me.

670
01:00:54,401 --> 01:00:55,694
I bought you a hamburger.

671
01:00:57,196 --> 01:00:58,280
Know what this is?

672
01:00:59,615 --> 01:01:01,533
What do they call it
in North Korea?

673
01:01:02,326 --> 01:01:04,703
Bread with meat?

674
01:01:06,455 --> 01:01:09,333
Try a taste of capitalism?

675
01:01:11,043 --> 01:01:14,713
The report said
your name is UHM Cheol-woo.

676
01:01:15,255 --> 01:01:19,134
We must be destined to meet.

677
01:01:19,218 --> 01:01:21,220
My name's KWAK Cheol-woo.

678
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:23,889
What does your name mean?

679
01:01:24,223 --> 01:01:26,016
Mine means 'bright world'.

680
01:01:26,892 --> 01:01:32,606
Born in 1977?
I'm a year older than you.

681
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:39,405
Show some respect
when I'm talking to you.

682
01:01:41,365 --> 01:01:42,408
What's wrong?

683
01:01:42,866 --> 01:01:45,869
Call a doctor! Now!

684
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,120
It's okay.

685
01:01:48,288 --> 01:01:49,415
Just give me painkillers.

686
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,709
Take all that.

687
01:01:53,585 --> 01:01:55,337
But let's give him this.

688
01:01:55,796 --> 01:01:57,005
Yes, sir.

689
01:02:00,384 --> 01:02:01,384
Here.

690
01:02:03,762 --> 01:02:07,391
Let's stop your drug addiction
while you're down here.

691
01:02:08,016 --> 01:02:11,437
You're a young man
with many years left to live.

692
01:02:12,604 --> 01:02:13,689
You must be cold.

693
01:02:22,114 --> 01:02:24,616
Want the hamburger?

694
01:02:34,418 --> 01:02:35,586
So?

695
01:02:36,295 --> 01:02:38,422
They'll come by tunnels
in secret.

696
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:40,758
Tunnels?

697
01:02:42,718 --> 01:02:45,846
Our country dug up
20 tunnels in the last 60 years.

698
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:50,017
I heard a handful
can reach here.

699
01:02:51,894 --> 01:02:53,353
Tunnels, huh?

700
01:02:58,192 --> 01:02:59,735
Who's coming down?

701
01:03:00,569 --> 01:03:02,696
The RGB controls the tunnels.

702
01:03:03,447 --> 01:03:07,159
Only our director
can open them in emergencies.

703
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:10,871
You mean director LEE Tae-Han?

704
01:03:12,790 --> 01:03:13,832
Wait.

705
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:20,255
He's a known hardliner on us.

706
01:03:21,799 --> 01:03:23,717
Would he come down
to stop the war?

707
01:03:25,302 --> 01:03:28,138
Such dichotomy won't do any good.

708
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:32,266
Why not just kill him when he comes
and start the war?

709
01:03:32,267 --> 01:03:33,894
Calm down, pal.

710
01:03:37,773 --> 01:03:40,275
You're sure LEE Tae-Han is coming?

711
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:45,364
If our Leader recovers,
PARK's coup is ruined.

712
01:03:46,198 --> 01:03:47,950
LEE will come
to make sure of that.

713
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:52,371
Take me to the meeting.
I'll explain to him.

714
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:10,764
He's close enough to LEE Tae-Han
to report directly to him, sir.

715
01:04:10,848 --> 01:04:13,225
- If we go with him...
<i>- LEE Tae-Han?</i>

716
01:04:13,475 --> 01:04:15,477
Director LEE Tae-Han of the RGB?

717
01:04:15,644 --> 01:04:16,228
Yes, sir.

718
01:04:16,229 --> 01:04:19,231
Then LEE will trust us.
It'll speed up the talks.

719
01:04:19,314 --> 01:04:21,107
We don't work with red guerrilla.

720
01:04:21,108 --> 01:04:22,025
What do you mean, sir?

721
01:04:22,109 --> 01:04:25,445
<i>He snuck in and used weapons.
That makes him a guerilla.</i>

722
01:04:26,405 --> 01:04:28,490
That guerrilla saved your ass.

723
01:04:28,699 --> 01:04:29,366
What the hell!

724
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:31,493
<i>Sorry, sir.
I thought you hung up.</i>

725
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:45,674
<i>This red dot is the GPS signal
of Chief Park's car.</i>

726
01:04:46,008 --> 01:04:47,384
<i>Just follow the signal, sir.</i>

727
01:04:55,767 --> 01:04:59,521
They agreed to send our Leader back
once he recovers, right?

728
01:05:02,274 --> 01:05:03,525
Probably.

729
01:05:04,192 --> 01:05:05,861
Unless he wants to defect to here.

730
01:05:06,153 --> 01:05:07,613
How dare you say that?

731
01:05:08,113 --> 01:05:09,698
Where is our Leader now?

732
01:05:10,073 --> 01:05:11,617
At a safe place.

733
01:05:12,868 --> 01:05:14,888
But he's probably not doing
so hot from the gun shots.

734
01:05:14,912 --> 01:05:18,498
Think this is funny?
Why do you always joke around?

735
01:05:18,749 --> 01:05:21,585
If he dies and they blame you,

736
01:05:21,752 --> 01:05:23,629
we'll be forced to go to war.

737
01:05:23,921 --> 01:05:26,047
Think you'll be joking then?

738
01:05:26,048 --> 01:05:27,341
I know, I know.

739
01:05:27,799 --> 01:05:29,927
I know it'll be war
if your No. 1 dies.

740
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:33,430
I have two kids.
Would I lie to you?

741
01:05:35,515 --> 01:05:40,312
They can't operate
until his brain pressure goes down.

742
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:45,525
Hold on.
What's he doing?

743
01:05:46,568 --> 01:05:48,779
Why stop here at Uijeongbu?

744
01:05:49,488 --> 01:05:51,031
Aren't they coming by tunnel?

745
01:05:55,535 --> 01:05:57,120
You folks dug to here?

746
01:05:58,664 --> 01:06:00,332
I don't know the exact locations.

747
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:04,169
Do you eat moles up there?

748
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:10,050
No way!
We eat rice with meat.

749
01:06:10,801 --> 01:06:14,096
If you don't eat moles,
how can you dig so well?

750
01:06:14,721 --> 01:06:17,349
When we're reunified,
you dig the subway lines.

751
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:26,900
Must be around here...

752
01:06:34,783 --> 01:06:38,745
You folks made lots of army bases
to prepare for war.

753
01:06:38,954 --> 01:06:40,831
So many army base pubs here.

754
01:06:41,081 --> 01:06:42,165
Look, pal.

755
01:06:43,542 --> 01:06:47,504
Those aren't army base pubs.

756
01:06:47,713 --> 01:06:53,885
During the time of our dad's uncles,
the army base stew was made.

757
01:06:54,011 --> 01:06:56,221
With some food from
American army bases.

758
01:06:57,889 --> 01:07:01,059
The Americans made the bases?

759
01:07:03,687 --> 01:07:05,230
Just forget it.

760
01:07:10,027 --> 01:07:12,320
I don't believe it.

761
01:07:12,612 --> 01:07:14,906
At a critical time like this?

762
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:20,078
They came here to eat.

763
01:07:22,164 --> 01:07:24,875
Aren't you hungry, pal?

764
01:07:26,793 --> 01:07:27,377
Forget it.

765
01:07:27,378 --> 01:07:28,670
Let's eat too.

766
01:07:31,381 --> 01:07:36,094
We need the energy
to interrupt their meeting.

767
01:07:36,470 --> 01:07:40,057
One of my favorite restaurants
is nearby here.

768
01:07:43,852 --> 01:07:46,146
Come on. It's just over there.

769
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:50,025
I haven't had this in a while.

770
01:08:02,996 --> 01:08:03,996
Why?

771
01:08:09,127 --> 01:08:10,170
Eat it.

772
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:42,159
Give me your hand.

773
01:08:55,132 --> 01:08:56,424
We're a team, right?

774
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:58,426
We're working together.

775
01:09:01,054 --> 01:09:02,054
Move over.

776
01:09:31,126 --> 01:09:33,128
Ma'am? Another bowl, please!

777
01:09:33,253 --> 01:09:35,964
And some dumplings too.

778
01:09:50,103 --> 01:09:51,229
Dang.

779
01:09:55,734 --> 01:09:57,027
You eat well.

780
01:10:02,115 --> 01:10:04,159
I didn't eat since Kaesong.

781
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:07,871
And

782
01:10:09,414 --> 01:10:14,211
you shoved the ham bread thing
in your mouth, remember?

783
01:10:16,254 --> 01:10:18,173
Eat all you want.

784
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:22,677
Eat up.

785
01:10:28,642 --> 01:10:30,268
I like skinny noodles.

786
01:10:31,102 --> 01:10:32,229
What's that?

787
01:10:33,146 --> 01:10:34,481
We ordered dumplings too.

788
01:10:38,777 --> 01:10:40,362
They're called skinny noodles.

789
01:10:41,321 --> 01:10:42,614
Are you a defector too?

790
01:10:43,615 --> 01:10:45,367
He came down here recently.

791
01:10:46,243 --> 01:10:47,869
Where are all the customers?

792
01:10:48,328 --> 01:10:49,968
They left because
it's close to the North?

793
01:10:50,538 --> 01:10:52,040
Aren't you heading south?

794
01:10:52,207 --> 01:10:56,002
If there's a war,
all of Korea won't be safe.

795
01:10:56,670 --> 01:11:01,216
I'm worried about my family
up there more than me.

796
01:11:13,019 --> 01:11:16,648
I'll unlock it.
No funny business, okay?

797
01:11:22,904 --> 01:11:23,989
I'll do it.

798
01:11:34,249 --> 01:11:35,959
Hey! Wait for me!

799
01:11:39,796 --> 01:11:41,298
My scarf!

800
01:11:43,550 --> 01:11:47,429
My wife gave me that.

801
01:11:50,974 --> 01:11:54,936
Got a wife and kids?
You left that information blank.

802
01:12:02,485 --> 01:12:06,448
I have a 13 year-old girl
and a 10 year-old boy.

803
01:12:08,283 --> 01:12:10,952
And you saw my ex-wife.

804
01:12:13,913 --> 01:12:16,040
Why'd you divorce the doctor?

805
01:12:16,041 --> 01:12:17,167
Dang.

806
01:12:19,085 --> 01:12:20,545
Let's not talk about that.

807
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:22,504
How about some music?

808
01:12:25,091 --> 01:12:28,178
I have a wife
and an 8 year-old girl.

809
01:12:32,057 --> 01:12:35,310
Do you know G-dragon,
the singer?

810
01:12:35,602 --> 01:12:38,355
Of course.
If you don't, you'd be a spy.

811
01:12:44,986 --> 01:12:47,238
Did you come before as a spy?

812
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:50,492
My daughter likes him.

813
01:12:52,077 --> 01:12:56,289
He's popular with the girls.
My daughter always plays his songs.

814
01:12:56,498 --> 01:12:57,916
That's him. Listen.

815
01:13:12,305 --> 01:13:15,308
This is world-class music?

816
01:13:15,392 --> 01:13:16,393
Your daughter said that?

817
01:13:16,851 --> 01:13:20,271
Then accept it.
My daughter always wins too.

818
01:13:21,856 --> 01:13:26,528
Forget the candy-coated comfort
Tonight, I'll be crooked

819
01:13:26,569 --> 01:13:28,029
Leave me alone

820
01:13:28,530 --> 01:13:31,449
I was alone anyway

821
01:13:31,950 --> 01:13:33,368
There is no reason

822
01:13:33,785 --> 01:13:35,537
There is no sincerity

823
01:13:56,099 --> 01:13:57,517
Is that LEE Tae-Han?

824
01:13:58,393 --> 01:14:00,854
Take a look.
I can't really tell.

825
01:14:12,449 --> 01:14:13,450
I can't see from here.

826
01:14:15,743 --> 01:14:18,955
Call LEE and tell him
we're close by.

827
01:14:19,038 --> 01:14:24,002
We can go if LEE lets us,
or else Chief PARK will be fuming!

828
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:37,932
I can't see.

829
01:14:38,516 --> 01:14:39,726
Is that him?

830
01:14:45,607 --> 01:14:46,607
What?

831
01:14:47,066 --> 01:14:48,066
What was that?

832
01:14:50,445 --> 01:14:51,863
- Snipers!
- What?

833
01:14:53,615 --> 01:14:54,616
Calm down.
Stay calm.

834
01:15:01,956 --> 01:15:03,041
Rocket launcher!

835
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:09,380
I'm at the Nodongdangsa!
Send troops here now!

836
01:15:14,511 --> 01:15:15,511
Get in!

837
01:15:16,054 --> 01:15:17,054
Hurry!

838
01:15:17,305 --> 01:15:18,515
Go after them.

839
01:16:01,349 --> 01:16:02,141
Take it!

840
01:16:02,225 --> 01:16:03,518
I trust you.

841
01:16:14,862 --> 01:16:15,862
Now!

842
01:16:51,649 --> 01:16:52,649
Director!

843
01:16:55,278 --> 01:16:56,863
Chief!

844
01:16:58,406 --> 01:16:59,406
Director!

845
01:17:14,172 --> 01:17:15,506
Who are you?

846
01:17:18,134 --> 01:17:19,594
- Who...
<i>- Comrade Cheol-woo.</i>

847
01:17:20,261 --> 01:17:22,680
<i>After this mission,</i>

848
01:17:22,847 --> 01:17:27,185
your family will be named heroes
for saving the country from a coup.

849
01:17:32,732 --> 01:17:33,732
What the hell!

850
01:17:35,193 --> 01:17:37,779
Are you out of your mind!

851
01:17:37,987 --> 01:17:40,572
It's the only way to stop the war!

852
01:17:40,573 --> 01:17:43,451
Why's that commie here!
What the hell did you do!

853
01:18:16,651 --> 01:18:18,277
Freeze! Don't move!

854
01:18:18,695 --> 01:18:21,030
I'm secretary KWAK Cheol-woo
of National Security.

855
01:18:21,322 --> 01:18:22,323
Call an ambulance!

856
01:18:22,657 --> 01:18:23,700
You're saying,

857
01:18:24,534 --> 01:18:30,498
PARK Gwang-dong, who raised the coup,
is dead, so the situation is over?

858
01:18:30,748 --> 01:18:34,252
The operative who brought
No. 1 down said that?

859
01:18:34,585 --> 01:18:35,837
Yes, sir.

860
01:18:35,962 --> 01:18:37,046
Where is he now?

861
01:18:37,130 --> 01:18:40,216
He's hurt and unconscious.
He's being treated now.

862
01:18:40,299 --> 01:18:41,342
Explain this.

863
01:18:44,345 --> 01:18:50,226
Chief Park had this recorded
before he died.

864
01:18:51,477 --> 01:18:53,271
<i>How's our Leader?</i>

865
01:18:53,396 --> 01:18:56,274
<i>He's being treated.
What's the situation there?</i>

866
01:18:56,566 --> 01:18:58,735
<i>Military traitors staged a coup.</i>

867
01:18:58,776 --> 01:19:02,404
<i>But I have control of Pyongyang
and the nuclear weapons.</i>

868
01:19:02,405 --> 01:19:03,656
<i>Don't worry.</i>

869
01:19:03,823 --> 01:19:05,658
<i>If our Leader is repatriated,</i>

870
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:08,745
<i>I'll take out the traitors
and retract the declaration...</i>

871
01:19:12,665 --> 01:19:13,916
They're always like this!

872
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,712
They said they wanted to talk,
then sunk the Cheonan!

873
01:19:17,795 --> 01:19:19,797
Then they attacked
Yeonpyeong Island!

874
01:19:20,089 --> 01:19:21,298
Only two things are certain now!

875
01:19:21,299 --> 01:19:25,302
They declared war
and have nuclear weapons!

876
01:19:25,303 --> 01:19:26,679
There is one more, sir.

877
01:19:27,138 --> 01:19:30,266
We have the North Korean leader.

878
01:19:30,391 --> 01:19:31,391
One more thing.

879
01:19:31,434 --> 01:19:35,313
People in North Korea
are trying hard to stop the war too.

880
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:40,193
Rather than trust them,
I'll consult with our allies.

881
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:43,154
You mean you'll issue
the preemptive attack?

882
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:48,868
Will you bet the lives of our people
on something with a 50% probability?

883
01:19:48,951 --> 01:19:52,663
The cost of war and
rebuilding North Korea aside,

884
01:19:52,789 --> 01:19:59,670
they'll never see us as compatriots
if we attack with nuclear bombs!

885
01:20:03,132 --> 01:20:04,884
Will you all excuse us?

886
01:20:08,679 --> 01:20:11,390
Let's be honest now.

887
01:20:12,141 --> 01:20:14,018
There's a coup in the North.

888
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:16,896
If we attack now,
they can't fight back.

889
01:20:17,146 --> 01:20:21,734
We never had a chance this good
to eliminate the threat of war here!

890
01:20:22,485 --> 01:20:25,905
If we miss this chance,
we'd be doing injustice to Korea.

891
01:20:28,282 --> 01:20:34,205
Before I step down,
let me give a gift to you

892
01:20:34,288 --> 01:20:36,666
and our country.

893
01:20:36,874 --> 01:20:38,292
This time, let's do as I say.

894
01:20:38,918 --> 01:20:43,923
Our economy and population rates
are all going down.

895
01:20:44,465 --> 01:20:45,758
Simply put?

896
01:20:46,384 --> 01:20:48,135
The country is going bust!

897
01:20:48,553 --> 01:20:52,305
If you don't understand
why a divided nation must be unified,

898
01:20:52,306 --> 01:20:54,976
then see reunification
as means for profit.

899
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:58,813
I disagree with a preemptive
nuclear strike.

900
01:20:59,897 --> 01:21:00,982
Good thing...

901
01:21:01,691 --> 01:21:04,277
The law still allows me
to decide that.

902
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:05,695
No, it's a pity.

903
01:21:06,279 --> 01:21:09,866
That someone with no respect
for history is still in rule.

904
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:29,886
- Secretary Kwak?
- Yes?

905
01:21:30,803 --> 01:21:33,306
- You're Mr. UHM Cheol-woo's guardian?
- Yes.

906
01:21:33,389 --> 01:21:38,019
We've discovered
he has metastatic lung cancer.

907
01:21:38,436 --> 01:21:42,982
He also has stage 4
pancreatic cancer.

908
01:21:43,107 --> 01:21:47,945
It spread to his spine.
He could get neurogenic shock too.

909
01:21:48,195 --> 01:21:51,032
He could die any minute.

910
01:21:53,784 --> 01:21:59,040
<i>Do you think he's aware of
his condition?</i>

911
01:21:59,999 --> 01:22:04,045
<i>He has to know.
He'd be in extreme pain.</i>

912
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:10,092
You're up?

913
01:22:12,637 --> 01:22:14,055
How do you feel?

914
01:22:15,181 --> 01:22:16,182
Good.

915
01:22:17,058 --> 01:22:18,058
Good.

916
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:19,727
I slept well for a change.

917
01:22:22,855 --> 01:22:25,608
The bullet wound must hurt.

918
01:22:26,525 --> 01:22:31,572
With all the painkillers,
I don't feel it.

919
01:22:31,906 --> 01:22:32,990
That's good.

920
01:22:40,081 --> 01:22:44,001
I'm glad, but...

921
01:22:47,588 --> 01:22:49,465
Why'd you kill PARK Gwang-dong?

922
01:22:50,049 --> 01:22:52,176
That's the order I received.

923
01:22:53,052 --> 01:22:56,097
PARK raised the coup,
so kill him.

924
01:22:57,556 --> 01:22:58,849
That's the reason?

925
01:22:59,266 --> 01:23:01,185
Don't you think it's weird?

926
01:23:01,936 --> 01:23:05,815
He started the coup
and was about to take over for good.

927
01:23:06,065 --> 01:23:09,068
Then why risk his life
to come down here?

928
01:23:09,944 --> 01:23:11,904
What are you getting at?

929
01:23:12,822 --> 01:23:15,282
Things don't add up.

930
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:20,121
Usually, coups are staged
by the military.

931
01:23:20,204 --> 01:23:25,251
But President Park was killed by
the director of the KCIA.

932
01:23:25,334 --> 01:23:26,585
Yes.

933
01:23:27,003 --> 01:23:30,297
But the military led
the coup later.

934
01:23:30,506 --> 01:23:31,632
Here too.

935
01:23:34,135 --> 01:23:37,054
Mr. Lee?

936
01:23:37,888 --> 01:23:39,015
Yes, sir.

937
01:23:40,099 --> 01:23:42,476
I'll be back. Get some rest.

938
01:23:46,147 --> 01:23:51,527
<i>As of 6:00 am today,
the nation is under martial law.</i>

939
01:23:51,819 --> 01:23:57,199
<i>A curfew will be in effect
from midnight to 5:00 am.</i>

940
01:23:57,408 --> 01:24:00,369
<i>Please return home
as soon as possible.</i>

941
01:24:04,415 --> 01:24:05,666
Going somewhere, sir?

942
01:24:06,876 --> 01:24:10,212
I'm returning to China.
I received orders to evacuate.

943
01:24:12,048 --> 01:24:15,968
It's urgent.
Let's exchange some information.

944
01:24:16,635 --> 01:24:19,180
How's No. 1?

945
01:24:19,346 --> 01:24:20,598
50:50.

946
01:24:21,182 --> 01:24:24,225
Who is China currently supporting
as a leader of North Korea?

947
01:24:24,226 --> 01:24:29,356
We can only support
the one in control of North Korea.

948
01:24:29,857 --> 01:24:36,405
So you told both the rebels
and the opposition that No. 1 is here?

949
01:24:38,324 --> 01:24:42,995
I didn't, but my superiors
may have done so.

950
01:24:43,704 --> 01:24:48,000
The coup was staged by
the military, right?

951
01:24:48,125 --> 01:24:52,421
No. 1 killed hundreds of generals
since he came into power.

952
01:24:53,005 --> 01:24:57,760
And he practically has
sole control of the nuclear weapons.

953
01:24:58,844 --> 01:25:00,179
Then who could it be?

954
01:25:00,763 --> 01:25:04,016
If we bomb North Korea,
will we be enemies?

955
01:25:04,517 --> 01:25:06,185
What will you give me?

956
01:25:06,227 --> 01:25:08,521
PARK Gwang-dong died
when he came down.

957
01:25:09,146 --> 01:25:10,397
I know that.

958
01:25:10,606 --> 01:25:12,983
Our president will not
expand North after the strike.

959
01:25:13,067 --> 01:25:15,111
Perhaps the next president will.

960
01:25:15,444 --> 01:25:19,156
After a nuclear bombing,
he won't be able to either.

961
01:25:19,949 --> 01:25:25,538
The Korean race will be forced into
another new Cold War.

962
01:25:26,872 --> 01:25:28,706
You're an ethnic Korean too.

963
01:25:28,707 --> 01:25:29,917
So what?

964
01:25:31,252 --> 01:25:33,754
Since when did Korea
treat us as brothers?

965
01:25:34,213 --> 01:25:37,424
You treat the rich as brothers,
but the poor as foreigners!

966
01:25:37,967 --> 01:25:40,219
Though I'm an ethnic Korean
in China,

967
01:25:40,302 --> 01:25:42,304
I'm 100% Chinese.

968
01:25:42,596 --> 01:25:45,849
China is firm on not sharing
our borders with the U.S.

969
01:25:45,850 --> 01:25:51,564
or with countries that have
military alliances with them.

970
01:25:52,273 --> 01:25:55,651
If North Korea is destroyed by war,
we'll have to take them in.

971
01:25:56,235 --> 01:25:59,864
I'll tell you one last thing.

972
01:26:01,115 --> 01:26:04,243
Our country doesn't like that.

973
01:26:04,702 --> 01:26:08,956
If we take them in,
our forces will be dispersed.

974
01:26:09,248 --> 01:26:13,711
That's what the Americans
and the Japanese want.

975
01:26:26,765 --> 01:26:28,267
Good evening, Mr. Takashi.

976
01:26:28,559 --> 01:26:30,186
Hello, Mr. Lee.

977
01:26:30,269 --> 01:26:32,313
Are you here to depart as well?

978
01:26:32,438 --> 01:26:33,438
Yes.

979
01:26:34,023 --> 01:26:35,274
Shall I introduce you?

980
01:26:35,482 --> 01:26:36,734
Mr. Kwak.

981
01:26:37,776 --> 01:26:41,280
This is Mr. Takashi of
the Japanese CIRO.

982
01:26:43,115 --> 01:26:44,325
He's an old acquaintance.

983
01:26:45,034 --> 01:26:46,785
How is No. 1's status?

984
01:26:46,911 --> 01:26:48,287
Fifty, fifty. (50: 50)

985
01:26:48,746 --> 01:26:49,997
Thank you.

986
01:27:00,841 --> 01:27:05,679
If you think of me as a brother,
take my advice.

987
01:27:08,515 --> 01:27:11,602
Stop this war.

988
01:27:14,647 --> 01:27:16,232
Escort Mr. Kwak home.

989
01:27:21,904 --> 01:27:25,532
How about the Faculty Chair
at Peking University?

990
01:27:39,755 --> 01:27:42,466
I'm Mr. Popular tonight.

991
01:27:47,221 --> 01:27:53,269
Look at all the shit you must do
for splitting up a country.

992
01:27:58,315 --> 01:27:59,858
I believe the president-elect

993
01:27:59,942 --> 01:28:02,528
will be asking for you
within the next few hours.

994
01:28:03,195 --> 01:28:04,363
When he does,

995
01:28:04,863 --> 01:28:07,366
please advise him to face up
to reality.

996
01:28:08,617 --> 01:28:10,577
Why should I do this?

997
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:14,957
Because you're the man that has the access
of both presidents right now, Mr. Kwak.

998
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:17,001
Face up to the reality of what?

999
01:28:17,084 --> 01:28:20,087
You remember how it was
when No. 1 succeeded his father.

1000
01:28:20,296 --> 01:28:24,466
The North Korean government overcomes
the crisis by creating tension.

1001
01:28:25,384 --> 01:28:27,303
So then ask yourself,

1002
01:28:27,678 --> 01:28:30,221
how far would these
military authorities go

1003
01:28:30,222 --> 01:28:33,350
to justify their new,
illegitimate regime?

1004
01:28:33,892 --> 01:28:35,686
According to our simulations,

1005
01:28:35,769 --> 01:28:38,230
this coup will result in war.

1006
01:28:40,941 --> 01:28:42,318
Excuse me.

1007
01:28:48,407 --> 01:28:51,035
It's me. Did anything happen?

1008
01:28:51,493 --> 01:28:53,704
Did they decide
to strike the North?

1009
01:28:54,246 --> 01:28:56,498
Find out anything you can.

1010
01:28:56,665 --> 01:28:58,708
<i>The Tag Heuer smart watch
you asked about...</i>

1011
01:28:58,709 --> 01:28:59,460
Yes?

1012
01:28:59,461 --> 01:29:01,253
NIS digital forensics called, sir.

1013
01:29:01,462 --> 01:29:02,713
<i>It's not just a watch.</i>

1014
01:29:02,796 --> 01:29:06,216
<i>They couldn't crack the firewall,
but it has a code generator.</i>

1015
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:07,718
A code generator?

1016
01:29:11,305 --> 01:29:13,390
A call from the president, sir.

1017
01:29:15,517 --> 01:29:18,187
<i>WHAT BELONGS TOGETHER
WILL GROW TOGETHER</i>

1018
01:29:18,228 --> 01:29:19,730
KIM KYUNG-young, speaking.

1019
01:29:20,314 --> 01:29:21,814
I inform you as the president.

1020
01:29:21,815 --> 01:29:25,026
I've agreed to a nuclear strike
on North Korea.

1021
01:29:25,027 --> 01:29:26,027
Mr. President!

1022
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:28,364
<i>War will break out and end
during my term.</i>

1023
01:29:28,489 --> 01:29:29,198
<i>Mr. President!</i>

1024
01:29:29,199 --> 01:29:31,617
- I'll take full responsibility.
<i>- Wait!</i>

1025
01:29:34,453 --> 01:29:37,748
I understand. The South Korean president
just agreed to a nuclear attack.

1026
01:29:42,586 --> 01:29:44,338
You're not heading back home?

1027
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:48,884
The Chinese and Japanese are
already calling their people back.

1028
01:29:50,469 --> 01:29:53,472
I've been told to wait it
out in Japan.

1029
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:59,311
Even the U.S. isn't sure
if it can totally disarm the North.

1030
01:30:03,107 --> 01:30:08,362
<i>MINOT AIR FORCE BASE</i>

1031
01:30:22,459 --> 01:30:25,421
The rest of the world
is thrown in a panic,

1032
01:30:25,546 --> 01:30:29,590
and yet, we have time
for a cup of coffee.

1033
01:30:29,591 --> 01:30:31,718
This is one hell of a nation, yeah?

1034
01:30:33,387 --> 01:30:34,430
May I?

1035
01:30:34,471 --> 01:30:35,889
Oh, yeah of course.

1036
01:30:38,892 --> 01:30:39,892
Thank you.

1037
01:30:40,310 --> 01:30:41,812
It's understandable.

1038
01:30:41,937 --> 01:30:43,312
Back in the States,

1039
01:30:43,313 --> 01:30:46,024
an average of ninety people
are shot to death every day.

1040
01:30:47,276 --> 01:30:51,530
Yes, there's the occasional outburst
demanding tougher gun control,

1041
01:30:51,697 --> 01:30:53,073
but that's about it.

1042
01:30:53,282 --> 01:30:54,407
The next day,

1043
01:30:54,408 --> 01:30:56,076
the sun comes up,

1044
01:30:56,535 --> 01:30:58,412
another ninety lives are lost.

1045
01:31:02,332 --> 01:31:03,542
It's sad

1046
01:31:05,419 --> 01:31:07,378
when violence becomes the norm.

1047
01:31:07,379 --> 01:31:09,589
Whether it's to
the sound of gunshots in the U.S.

1048
01:31:09,590 --> 01:31:11,758
or talk of imminent war in Korea.

1049
01:31:13,051 --> 01:31:15,721
All I can do is just pray that

1050
01:31:15,804 --> 01:31:20,517
you people would eliminate
counterattack ability of the north

1051
01:31:20,767 --> 01:31:26,648
or that they would retract
their declaration of war.

1052
01:31:27,733 --> 01:31:30,736
I would put my money
on the former option, Mr. Kwak.

1053
01:31:32,696 --> 01:31:34,323
The best of luck to you.

1054
01:31:38,202 --> 01:31:39,327
PARK Gwang-dong said that

1055
01:31:39,328 --> 01:31:40,913
CHOI Chul-min went south, sir.

1056
01:31:40,996 --> 01:31:42,331
CHOI Chul-min?

1057
01:31:42,456 --> 01:31:46,543
He leaked our coordinates.
We should kill him!

1058
01:31:46,627 --> 01:31:49,421
Forget it.
Pyongyang comes first.

1059
01:31:50,214 --> 01:31:55,886
Once we declare ourselves as
new leaders, he's dead anyway.

1060
01:31:56,053 --> 01:31:57,053
Leave him.

1061
01:32:16,406 --> 01:32:18,450
What are you doing?
Will you shoot or not?

1062
01:32:20,118 --> 01:32:22,538
Damn indecisive soldier.

1063
01:32:24,957 --> 01:32:26,291
Got something to say?

1064
01:32:26,333 --> 01:32:28,377
I just did my job
to protect Pyongyang.

1065
01:32:28,585 --> 01:32:30,546
From whom is what matters!

1066
01:32:33,257 --> 01:32:34,591
Where's the detonator?

1067
01:32:37,803 --> 01:32:38,845
The codes?

1068
01:32:43,225 --> 01:32:44,351
There should be two.

1069
01:32:45,310 --> 01:32:48,689
Our Leader keeps the other one
on him at all times.

1070
01:32:53,026 --> 01:32:57,864
Retracting the war declaration
can stop the nuclear strike?

1071
01:32:57,948 --> 01:33:02,619
It has be retracted first
to at least try to stop it.

1072
01:33:09,793 --> 01:33:10,919
Give me my phone.

1073
01:33:16,592 --> 01:33:19,636
You got many calls.
Are they from LEE Tae-Han?

1074
01:33:32,524 --> 01:33:33,984
Director? It's Cheol-woo.

1075
01:33:34,359 --> 01:33:36,111
American nuclear bombers
are on their way.

1076
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:37,654
If we retract...

1077
01:33:40,198 --> 01:33:41,283
Pardon?

1078
01:33:45,579 --> 01:33:46,580
Yes.

1079
01:33:49,666 --> 01:33:51,251
I'm in the hospital.

1080
01:33:52,377 --> 01:33:54,671
Just one guard, sir.

1081
01:33:57,633 --> 01:33:58,800
A watch?

1082
01:34:01,261 --> 01:34:02,679
What watch?

1083
01:34:04,473 --> 01:34:07,809
Yes, I remember.
Our Leader was wearing it.

1084
01:34:13,357 --> 01:34:15,942
I don't have it,
but I know where it is.

1085
01:34:22,699 --> 01:34:26,703
Then who should I meet and where?

1086
01:34:31,291 --> 01:34:32,626
Yes, sir.

1087
01:34:41,551 --> 01:34:42,803
Call in the hacker troops.

1088
01:34:43,428 --> 01:34:44,596
What did he say?

1089
01:34:46,556 --> 01:34:49,559
He heard from China
about the nuclear strike.

1090
01:34:50,977 --> 01:34:53,730
And that he'll retract
the declaration of war.

1091
01:34:55,649 --> 01:34:57,651
That's good.

1092
01:35:00,821 --> 01:35:01,738
But...

1093
01:35:01,822 --> 01:35:05,659
What was that about
a watch and a meeting?

1094
01:35:09,037 --> 01:35:11,039
Our Leader's watch...

1095
01:35:12,165 --> 01:35:14,918
He says to return
to the North with it.

1096
01:35:16,044 --> 01:35:22,801
Do you know it's a code generator
for nuclear missiles?

1097
01:35:37,190 --> 01:35:40,569
With all the sanctions against us...

1098
01:35:42,154 --> 01:35:44,990
a thought went around
in the military.

1099
01:35:47,534 --> 01:35:49,703
Using the nukes will kill us,

1100
01:35:50,662 --> 01:35:54,833
but maybe it's better than
starving to death from sanctions.

1101
01:35:55,792 --> 01:35:58,879
So the military devices
the last resort.

1102
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:02,215
If negotiations
with nukes won't work,

1103
01:36:02,549 --> 01:36:05,051
then use Seoul
and the U.S. military.

1104
01:36:05,427 --> 01:36:06,428
What do you mean?

1105
01:36:09,556 --> 01:36:12,142
If we set off a nuclear rocket
over Daejeon,

1106
01:36:12,684 --> 01:36:15,645
all communication equipment
in the South will burn.

1107
01:36:15,812 --> 01:36:18,732
All their proudly advanced weapons
will become scrap metal.

1108
01:36:19,483 --> 01:36:24,446
Then 250,000 of our Special Forces
will seize Seoul and the U.S. army.

1109
01:36:25,822 --> 01:36:28,909
Then the U.S. will be forced
to negotiate.

1110
01:36:28,950 --> 01:36:35,499
Our military thought it was
the only way to protect ourselves.

1111
01:36:37,334 --> 01:36:38,376
But

1112
01:36:39,503 --> 01:36:43,131
when our Leader heard the plan
and didn't implement it,

1113
01:36:43,715 --> 01:36:45,425
some military leaders grumbled

1114
01:36:48,512 --> 01:36:56,186
that he intends to use the nukes
for himself and not the Republic.

1115
01:37:00,857 --> 01:37:01,900
There's a saying.

1116
01:37:04,027 --> 01:37:07,322
People of a divided nation
suffer more

1117
01:37:07,906 --> 01:37:11,326
from those who use
the division for political gain

1118
01:37:12,410 --> 01:37:14,287
than the division itself.

1119
01:37:20,168 --> 01:37:22,254
Wanting the watch...

1120
01:37:25,298 --> 01:37:27,676
It means he'll implement that plan.

1121
01:37:29,636 --> 01:37:30,971
How long will it take?

1122
01:37:31,388 --> 01:37:35,517
I'm not sure, sir.
Perhaps 3 months?

1123
01:37:42,607 --> 01:37:44,317
How old are you?

1124
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:46,987
I'm 19 years old, sir!

1125
01:37:47,195 --> 01:37:48,195
19?

1126
01:37:49,406 --> 01:37:52,576
Maybe you're too young to know.

1127
01:37:53,034 --> 01:37:54,703
I'll explain.

1128
01:37:55,120 --> 01:37:56,371
Attention!

1129
01:37:58,874 --> 01:38:03,378
20 years ago,
3 million people died!

1130
01:38:04,045 --> 01:38:06,548
They starved to death!

1131
01:38:07,757 --> 01:38:13,763
Still, it didn't stop us
from making the nuclear rockets!

1132
01:38:14,389 --> 01:38:17,851
They're all ready!

1133
01:38:18,727 --> 01:38:23,856
But if you can't break the codes,
it's the same as not having them!

1134
01:38:23,857 --> 01:38:26,568
How absurd is that!

1135
01:38:28,904 --> 01:38:33,116
The Americans will jump
at the chance to strike.

1136
01:38:34,034 --> 01:38:35,118
Three months?

1137
01:38:35,702 --> 01:38:40,081
Die now rather than
get killed by Americans!

1138
01:38:40,165 --> 01:38:43,460
Cracking the entire system
will take three months,

1139
01:38:43,793 --> 01:38:47,839
but we can crack each one
in a week, sir!

1140
01:38:47,881 --> 01:38:49,174
I'll give you one day.

1141
01:38:50,008 --> 01:38:51,384
Yes, sir.

1142
01:39:01,895 --> 01:39:03,271
Check authentication code.

1143
01:39:05,982 --> 01:39:09,444
Victor, Quebec, delta, Sierra,
Golf, Kilo, Five, One, Three, Niner.

1144
01:39:09,903 --> 01:39:13,448
Victor, Quebec, delta, Sierra,
Golf, Kilo, Five, One, Three, Niner.

1145
01:39:13,782 --> 01:39:15,575
Authentication code confirmed.

1146
01:39:15,951 --> 01:39:17,452
Assign target coordinates.

1147
01:39:18,036 --> 01:39:19,788
Target One, Pyongyang.

1148
01:39:19,913 --> 01:39:21,915
Target Two, Wonsan.

1149
01:39:21,998 --> 01:39:23,583
Target Three, Nampo.

1150
01:39:23,792 --> 01:39:25,251
Target Four, Haeju.

1151
01:39:25,627 --> 01:39:28,170
<i>A reliable source in the
South Korean government tells us</i>

1152
01:39:28,171 --> 01:39:32,008
<i>that the nation's top neurosurgeons have
been appointed to the North Korean leader</i>

1153
01:39:32,133 --> 01:39:35,220
<i>who is scheduled for surgery once
his condition improves.</i>

1154
01:39:44,104 --> 01:39:45,105
China is fuming!

1155
01:39:45,355 --> 01:39:48,817
The nuclear bombers are coming.
They want to declaration retracted now.

1156
01:39:50,068 --> 01:39:51,736
It'll be announced soon.

1157
01:39:53,196 --> 01:39:54,239
The watch...

1158
01:39:55,824 --> 01:39:57,742
Now, we know where it is.

1159
01:39:58,743 --> 01:39:59,786
Get it.

1160
01:40:05,375 --> 01:40:07,042
May I see some ID, please?

1161
01:40:07,043 --> 01:40:08,043
Security service.

1162
01:40:08,128 --> 01:40:09,128
Open the gates!

1163
01:40:20,140 --> 01:40:21,140
Attention!

1164
01:40:21,433 --> 01:40:22,434
Sir!

1165
01:40:22,767 --> 01:40:23,767
At ease!

1166
01:40:35,405 --> 01:40:41,036
<i>The Supreme Command retracts
PARK Gwang-dong's declaration of war</i>

1167
01:40:41,119 --> 01:40:48,208
<i>and suggests talks
with the Republic of Korea to...</i>

1168
01:40:48,209 --> 01:40:49,919
The president called for you, sir.

1169
01:40:51,004 --> 01:40:53,547
<i>Their troops and mobile missile
launchers have, in fact,</i>

1170
01:40:53,548 --> 01:40:57,010
<i>shown an increase in activity
following the retraction.</i>

1171
01:40:57,093 --> 01:41:01,973
<i>We firmly believe that this is a standard
North Korean diversionary tactic.</i>

1172
01:41:02,098 --> 01:41:04,391
<i>While seeming to open
themselves to negotiations,</i>

1173
01:41:04,392 --> 01:41:07,729
<i>they're secretly mobilizing
their forces for military action.</i>

1174
01:41:18,281 --> 01:41:19,281
<i>What's that?</i>

1175
01:41:19,449 --> 01:41:22,035
<i>Is that... That sounds like gun fire.
Is that gun fire?</i>

1176
01:41:23,119 --> 01:41:24,412
We're under attack.

1177
01:41:24,496 --> 01:41:27,040
Please stay in the bunker
until the situation is over.

1178
01:41:27,248 --> 01:41:29,667
Team 1 and 2
to the Blue House now!

1179
01:41:29,918 --> 01:41:30,918
Yes, sir!

1180
01:41:32,087 --> 01:41:34,047
The Blue House was attacked?

1181
01:41:35,215 --> 01:41:36,508
By who? How?

1182
01:41:38,134 --> 01:41:39,134
Don't know?

1183
01:41:40,053 --> 01:41:42,388
It's a decoy.
They'll attack here!

1184
01:41:47,143 --> 01:41:48,143
Get started.

1185
01:41:49,104 --> 01:41:50,814
Stop! Stop!

1186
01:41:51,189 --> 01:41:52,690
- What is it?
- It's an emergency!

1187
01:41:52,774 --> 01:41:54,817
You can't go in
without permission.

1188
01:41:54,818 --> 01:41:57,195
He's injured badly.
He could die!

1189
01:41:58,530 --> 01:42:00,573
- Go check.
- Yes, sir.

1190
01:42:34,566 --> 01:42:35,817
Rooftop, clear.

1191
01:42:36,192 --> 01:42:37,610
Front gate, clear.

1192
01:42:48,246 --> 01:42:49,246
Move in.

1193
01:43:33,958 --> 01:43:34,958
Grenade!

1194
01:43:41,925 --> 01:43:42,925
Flash!

1195
01:43:49,432 --> 01:43:50,767
Bring the bodies!

1196
01:47:05,336 --> 01:47:06,421
Freeze!

1197
01:47:09,424 --> 01:47:10,550
Drop the gun!

1198
01:47:26,941 --> 01:47:28,025
Hurry! Get going!

1199
01:47:30,403 --> 01:47:32,864
- Go finish the surgery.
- Yes, sir.

1200
01:47:33,990 --> 01:47:34,990
This way!

1201
01:47:39,370 --> 01:47:40,455
National Security!

1202
01:47:42,540 --> 01:47:45,918
He's with us!
He's with us!

1203
01:47:46,752 --> 01:47:47,752
Are you okay?

1204
01:47:49,213 --> 01:47:50,339
Where's our Leader?

1205
01:47:51,340 --> 01:47:52,758
Safely headed to another hospital.

1206
01:48:08,566 --> 01:48:09,566
Sit down.

1207
01:48:13,488 --> 01:48:16,782
This means they'll start the war
no matter what.

1208
01:48:17,909 --> 01:48:19,285
I'll be the bait.

1209
01:48:19,660 --> 01:48:21,162
I'll go meet LEE Tae-Han.

1210
01:48:21,579 --> 01:48:23,539
Put a tracker on the watch
and give it to me.

1211
01:48:24,081 --> 01:48:27,293
Then bomb my location.

1212
01:48:34,592 --> 01:48:36,802
Sir! We've accessed
the first one!

1213
01:48:42,266 --> 01:48:43,351
Prepare to launch it!

1214
01:48:59,408 --> 01:49:04,247
China says they invested in it
for over 20 years, sir.

1215
01:49:04,872 --> 01:49:09,669
They're giving it to us at the risk of
exposing their advanced technology.

1216
01:49:10,628 --> 01:49:14,632
They say not to forget
their friendship and kindness.

1217
01:49:15,883 --> 01:49:21,138
Obviously, they're doing it
to humiliate the U.S. through us.

1218
01:49:22,431 --> 01:49:23,431
Give me that.

1219
01:49:25,685 --> 01:49:26,686
Deliver this.

1220
01:49:27,603 --> 01:49:34,860
North Korea and China are brothers
fighting against Japan and the U.S.

1221
01:49:35,820 --> 01:49:40,491
We will always remain brothers.

1222
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:44,662
We will never forget this favor.

1223
01:49:59,969 --> 01:50:03,931

They'll give the coordinates!

1229
01:50:45,514 --> 01:50:46,514
Change them.

1230
01:50:46,766 --> 01:50:50,811
Sir? It's not Daejeon city,
but the middle of the sea.

1231
01:50:51,187 --> 01:50:55,483
The Americans fired
nuclear missiles at our republic!

1232
01:50:55,691 --> 01:50:56,691
Launch it now!

1233
01:51:05,409 --> 01:51:06,410
Sir! Sir!

1234
01:51:06,702 --> 01:51:09,102
A missile launch has been detected
in South Pyongan Province.

1235
01:51:09,330 --> 01:51:10,665
Projected target?

1236
01:51:12,625 --> 01:51:13,918
Target projected at Japan.

1237
01:51:14,251 --> 01:51:15,294

01:51:17,588 --> 01:51:18,588
Yes, sir.

1239
01:51:18,589 --> 01:51:19,757
Prepare to intercept!

1240
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:24,470
- Prepared to intercept!
- Fire!

1241
01:52:27,491 --> 01:52:29,618
Quiet down!

1242
01:52:31,537 --> 01:52:32,663
Get back to work.

1243
01:52:36,667 --> 01:52:39,545
Announce the following
on Central TV.

1244
01:52:40,421 --> 01:52:47,303
We crushed the wicked U.S. invaders
who tried to annihilate us.

1245
01:52:47,803 --> 01:52:52,516
<i>JAPANESE PRIME MINISTER'S RESIDENCE
It proves what can happen
to us without our nuclear weapons.</i>

1246
01:52:52,767 --> 01:52:55,853
<i>Our nuclear weapons
are for self-defense.</i>

1247
01:52:56,395 --> 01:53:00,274
<i>However, if the U.S. dares try
to attack us again...</i>

1248
01:53:00,775 --> 01:53:02,485
<i>Mr. Prime Minister, sir.</i>

1249
01:53:06,071 --> 01:53:06,614
Yes, sir.

1250
01:53:06,615 --> 01:53:09,825
<i>Japan will be vanished
from the earth.</i>

1251
01:53:09,867 --> 01:53:12,745
But why fire at Japan, sir?

1252
01:53:13,746 --> 01:53:18,834
The Americans listen to
the Japanese more than us.

1253
01:53:19,627 --> 01:53:20,711
Yes, sir.

1254
01:53:28,052 --> 01:53:31,931
A North Korean nuclear missile
exploded over the East Sea.

1255
01:53:36,393 --> 01:53:37,937
They must've hacked one.

1256
01:53:38,062 --> 01:53:40,272
If they hack the next code,
they'll shoot here.

1257
01:53:40,481 --> 01:53:42,191
Comrade Kwak!

1258
01:53:43,692 --> 01:53:45,778
Say that our Leader has died.

1259
01:53:46,028 --> 01:53:50,741
If LEE thinks our Leader is dead,
it'll buy us some time.

1260
01:53:52,409 --> 01:53:53,452
Listen to me!

1261
01:53:54,870 --> 01:53:58,207
The longer I stay here,
the more dangerous it gets!

1262
01:54:03,671 --> 01:54:04,964
No. 1 is dead.

1263
01:54:05,881 --> 01:54:06,881
Gotcha.

1264
01:54:12,471 --> 01:54:13,931
<i>NO. 1 DIED</i>

1265
01:54:32,074 --> 01:54:35,327
- Is No. 1 really dead?
- No.

1266
01:54:35,703 --> 01:54:38,372
He's at another hospital
to undergo surgery.

1267
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:43,627
This place is a frenzy.

1268
01:54:43,961 --> 01:54:47,798
They requested another strike,
but the U.S. won't do it.

1269
01:54:47,882 --> 01:54:48,799
What?

1270
01:54:48,883 --> 01:54:52,468
<i>By now, they realize we will launch
a preemptive nuclear strike upon</i>

1271
01:54:52,469 --> 01:54:54,054
<i>any hint of an attack.</i>

1272
01:54:54,388 --> 01:54:56,807
<i>So they will not dare
to move recklessly.</i>

1273
01:54:57,057 --> 01:55:01,228
<i>We need to consider the collective
security of our entire treaty.</i>

1274
01:55:01,687 --> 01:55:04,732
<i>Plus they have already retracted
their declaration.</i>

1275
01:55:04,815 --> 01:55:07,484
But they launched the missile
after the retraction!

1276
01:55:07,693 --> 01:55:09,403
That makes no sense!

1277
01:55:09,695 --> 01:55:13,699
Is our alliance worth nothing
compared to yours with Japan?

1278
01:55:14,033 --> 01:55:15,492
<i>You better watch
what you are saying.</i>

1279
01:55:15,701 --> 01:55:18,578
<i>Instead of insisting we solve
your own problems for you,</i>

1280
01:55:18,579 --> 01:55:20,705
<i>would you please try to
perceive the situation</i>

1281
01:55:20,706 --> 01:55:22,875
from the point of view
of your allies.

1282
01:55:23,250 --> 01:55:26,503
<i>Let's just wait it out.</i>

1283
01:55:30,007 --> 01:55:36,138
Do you think we can destroy
all their nuclear weapons?

1284
01:55:38,098 --> 01:55:43,020
If we miss even just one...

1285
01:55:49,860 --> 01:55:51,528
don't give your consent, sir.

1286
01:55:51,946 --> 01:55:53,489
I'll take full responsibility.

1287
01:55:55,032 --> 01:55:56,951
No, I give consent.

1288
01:55:57,826 --> 01:55:59,828
Let's try everything we can.

1289
01:56:07,378 --> 01:56:08,504
Feeling better?

1290
01:56:13,634 --> 01:56:15,970
Looking good, pal.

1291
01:56:20,015 --> 01:56:21,809
Will you excuse us?

1292
01:56:26,480 --> 01:56:30,109
They took out the code generator
and put in the tracker.

1293
01:56:30,275 --> 01:56:32,528
It'll work up to 200 meters underground.

1294
01:56:32,611 --> 01:56:34,738
It's made of radioactive material.

1295
01:56:34,989 --> 01:56:36,615
See this red button?

1296
01:56:37,366 --> 01:56:41,161
If you press this,
it changes the signal.

1297
01:56:42,037 --> 01:56:43,914
Then we'll know you're there.

1298
01:56:47,751 --> 01:56:50,295
It's bad for you.
Give me that.

1299
01:56:50,963 --> 01:56:52,214
Thanks for worrying.

1300
01:56:55,217 --> 01:56:56,301
Why?

1301
01:56:58,637 --> 01:57:00,806
Worried about me
not living long?

1302
01:57:03,642 --> 01:57:06,812
No, I don't want
the radiation around me.

1303
01:57:09,982 --> 01:57:11,066
Hold on.

1304
01:57:13,068 --> 01:57:14,862
- Wear this.
- Forget it.

1305
01:57:15,654 --> 01:57:19,408
It's South Korea.
Wanna advertise you're a commie?

1306
01:57:20,659 --> 01:57:21,659
Here.

1307
01:57:37,843 --> 01:57:41,430
So, Cheol-woo.
What does your name mean?

1308
01:57:44,266 --> 01:57:47,603
It means 'strong friendship'.

1309
01:57:48,979 --> 01:57:53,484
Your name means
'bright world', right?

1310
01:57:53,567 --> 01:57:58,113
Good memory.
I thought you didn't hear me.

1311
01:58:02,785 --> 01:58:05,996
Tell me something funny.

1312
01:58:06,413 --> 01:58:07,831
I'm not interested.

1313
01:58:08,457 --> 01:58:10,250
I gotta lighten up the mood, huh?

1314
01:58:13,253 --> 01:58:16,298
Know why my friend
is moving to Seoul?

1315
01:58:18,050 --> 01:58:19,635
How would I know?

1316
01:58:23,680 --> 01:58:25,974
It's a good Korea move.

1317
01:58:31,021 --> 01:58:36,902
What's the name of a place
where chubby people live here?

1318
01:58:37,152 --> 01:58:38,987
There's a place like that?

1319
01:58:39,822 --> 01:58:43,200
Banpo-dong! (pun for half-fat)

1320
01:58:46,453 --> 01:58:52,209
Then, what's the place
where really fat people live?

1321
01:58:56,296 --> 01:58:57,214
Gaepo-dong! (big fat)

1322
01:58:57,297 --> 01:58:59,633
How did you know?

1323
01:59:01,468 --> 01:59:03,220
You were a spy, weren't you!

1324
01:59:04,346 --> 01:59:06,390
I should report you
for the reward.

1325
01:59:06,890 --> 01:59:10,477
I saw some of your comedy shows.

1326
01:59:11,311 --> 01:59:13,105
Why you little...

1327
01:59:13,856 --> 01:59:19,111
You warn your girl not to listen
to our music, but you watched shows?

1328
01:59:26,243 --> 01:59:27,243
Comrade UHM?

1329
01:59:27,744 --> 01:59:29,204
What comrade Kwak?

1330
01:59:33,333 --> 01:59:34,918
Make it out alive.

1331
01:59:41,800 --> 01:59:43,468
And gain some weight.

1332
01:59:44,261 --> 01:59:45,261
I'll lose some.

1333
01:59:47,139 --> 01:59:50,851
Then let's live together
in Banpo-dong.

1334
01:59:53,228 --> 01:59:55,189
And have drinks sometimes...

1335
02:00:02,279 --> 02:00:06,325
What is G-Dragon saying anyway?

1336
02:00:09,119 --> 02:00:10,913
I don't know either.

1337
02:00:11,121 --> 02:00:17,252
<i>My heart is cod and
there's no one to say.</i>

1338
02:00:17,544 --> 02:00:25,093
<i>Sometimes I want to laugh,
but there's no one by me.</i>

1339
02:00:25,302 --> 02:00:28,722
<i>Maybe I'm missing you oh oh</i>

1340
02:00:29,097 --> 02:00:32,601
<i>Maybe I'm missing you oh oh</i>

1341
02:00:32,976 --> 02:00:36,563
<i>Maybe I'm missing you oh oh</i>

1342
02:00:36,897 --> 02:00:38,482
<i>Maybe I'm missing you</i>

1343
02:00:40,692 --> 02:00:41,860
Here you go.

1344
02:00:52,496 --> 02:00:53,830
May I borrow that?

1345
02:00:56,333 --> 02:00:57,333
My card?

1346
02:00:58,335 --> 02:01:02,214
I can't say I'll pay you back,
but let me use it?

1347
02:01:17,562 --> 02:01:18,562
Thank you!

1348
02:01:46,216 --> 02:01:48,176
This is the address you gave me.

1349
02:02:08,989 --> 02:02:10,115
I'll be going then.

1350
02:02:11,992 --> 02:02:15,287
Are you sure
this is the right place?

1351
02:02:15,746 --> 02:02:16,746
It looks like it.

1352
02:02:18,040 --> 02:02:20,334
I'll wait for you here
just in case.

1353
02:02:21,585 --> 02:02:24,296
No, let's just part here.

1354
02:02:31,762 --> 02:02:34,014
Damn commie is so cold.

1355
02:02:37,517 --> 02:02:38,518
What?

1356
02:02:38,727 --> 02:02:39,728
It's not here?

1357
02:02:40,145 --> 02:02:41,145
Comrade Cheol-woo.

1358
02:02:41,772 --> 02:02:45,650
It's weird hearing my name
from you.

1359
02:02:48,153 --> 02:02:51,490
Once this is over,
send the girl back to the North?

1360
02:02:52,324 --> 02:02:53,950
Her family will be waiting.

1361
02:02:55,160 --> 02:02:56,536
Of course, I will.

1362
02:02:57,412 --> 02:03:01,416
You should make peace
with your wife too.

1363
02:03:01,875 --> 02:03:04,336
- The doctor seemed really nice.
- I know that.

1364
02:03:05,629 --> 02:03:07,339
You forgot your things.

1365
02:03:08,423 --> 02:03:09,424
Comrade Cheol-woo.

1366
02:03:10,550 --> 02:03:11,550
Yes?

1367
02:03:12,302 --> 02:03:16,848
If things end well,

1368
02:03:18,767 --> 02:03:23,688
and travel is allowed
between our countries,

1369
02:03:24,898 --> 02:03:29,694
please send them
to this address.

1370
02:03:37,411 --> 02:03:39,162
The pink one is for my girl.

1371
02:03:39,246 --> 02:03:40,705
The blue one is for my wife.

1372
02:03:48,338 --> 02:03:50,424
Thanks for everything, Cheol-woo.

1373
02:04:13,447 --> 02:04:15,115
My steel-strong pal!

1374
02:04:17,284 --> 02:04:18,452
Take care!

1375
02:04:20,370 --> 02:04:21,538
Take care...

1376
02:04:30,547 --> 02:04:31,548
I'm so sorry.

1377
02:05:20,639 --> 02:05:22,682
- Comrade UHM?
- Yes.

1378
02:05:24,643 --> 02:05:25,810
Welcome back home.

1379
02:06:26,538 --> 02:06:27,538
At present,

1380
02:06:27,956 --> 02:06:31,710
LEE Tae-Han has seized control
of North Korea.

1381
02:06:32,168 --> 02:06:37,465
We suspect he and his men
are working from a secret bunker.

1382
02:06:37,549 --> 02:06:39,634
But we don't know
their exact location.

1383
02:06:41,761 --> 02:06:47,601
<i>A North Korean named
UHM Cheol-woo,</i>

1384
02:06:48,435 --> 02:06:53,481
<i>who brought No. 1 down from Kaesong
and requested our help,</i>

1385
02:06:53,690 --> 02:06:58,570
<i>has gone back up
to meet LEE Tae-Han.</i>

1386
02:06:59,446 --> 02:07:03,283
<i>We put a tracking device on him.</i>

1387
02:07:04,075 --> 02:07:07,454
<i>His location is being traced live.</i>

1388
02:07:08,079 --> 02:07:09,414
Well done, comrade UHM.

1389
02:07:10,582 --> 02:07:12,334
The director is waiting for you.

1390
02:07:19,591 --> 02:07:23,345
I command
the Republic's most elite troops!

1391
02:07:24,137 --> 02:07:28,767
<i>At last, after dozens of years,</i>

1392
02:07:29,017 --> 02:07:34,189
<i>the end has come for
the Americans and their allies.</i>

1393
02:07:34,856 --> 02:07:36,941
<i>In a few minutes,</i>

1394
02:07:37,067 --> 02:07:43,573
<i>our proud nuclear bombs
will explode over South Korea!</i>

1395
02:07:44,324 --> 02:07:50,872
<i>Their cherished American weapons
will be turned into scrap metal!</i>

1396
02:07:51,331 --> 02:07:52,749
<i>Comrades! Be proud of...</i>

1397
02:07:53,625 --> 02:07:56,836
You killed hundreds of our people
by bombing Kaesong!

1398
02:07:57,170 --> 02:08:00,757
How can our soldiers
kill our people!

1399
02:08:02,634 --> 02:08:04,344
You betrayed me?

1400
02:08:04,594 --> 02:08:06,429
Why'd you betray our Leader!

1401
02:08:06,513 --> 02:08:08,723
Who betrayed who!

1402
02:08:08,890 --> 02:08:13,603
He executed over 100 generals
in our military!

1403
02:08:13,770 --> 02:08:17,232
We're the ones
who were betrayed!

1404
02:08:17,524 --> 02:08:22,696
<i>We built this country
and protected it all these years!</i>

1405
02:08:22,779 --> 02:08:27,033
We made countless opportunities
to liberate South Korea!

1406
02:08:27,158 --> 02:08:32,706
We even made nuclear weapons,
but he won't use them!

1407
02:08:34,958 --> 02:08:37,669
A friend I met in the South
said this!

1408
02:08:39,504 --> 02:08:43,049
Rather than division itself,
people of a divided nation

1409
02:08:43,258 --> 02:08:46,469
suffer more from those
who take advantage of it!

1410
02:08:48,680 --> 02:08:51,891
I witnessed that suffering
in Kaesong!

1411
02:08:54,060 --> 02:08:58,189
I can't let the entire country
suffer too!

1412
02:09:09,701 --> 02:09:12,036
A bomb will strike here!
Get out!

1413
02:09:26,301 --> 02:09:30,054
I request the order to strike.

1414
02:10:15,725 --> 02:10:16,725
Take care...

1415
02:10:18,895 --> 02:10:20,188
everyone.

1416
02:11:05,567 --> 02:11:07,443
<i>My beloved citizens,</i>

1417
02:11:07,777 --> 02:11:13,324
<i>I believe there should never be
a war on this land ever again.</i>

1418
02:11:13,950 --> 02:11:17,287
I will actively seek peace talks
with North Korea.

1419
02:11:17,579 --> 02:11:18,496
<i>INTER-KOREAN TRANSIT OFFICE</i>

1420
02:11:18,497 --> 02:11:23,710
<i>INTER-KOREAN TRANSIT OFFICE
A divided nation
must be united again!</i>

1421
02:11:24,586 --> 02:11:29,549
<i>It's the only way to heal the pains
of the last 100 years of our land!</i>

1422
02:11:29,632 --> 02:11:32,259
<i>It will also contribute
to world peace.</i>

1423
02:11:32,260 --> 02:11:35,430
Welcome to the democratic People's
Republic of Korea.

1424
02:11:39,893 --> 02:11:40,935
He's waiting inside.

1425
02:11:44,564 --> 02:11:46,482
Welcome, Mr. Gwak.

1426
02:11:46,566 --> 02:11:47,901
How is our Leader?

1427
02:11:48,026 --> 02:11:49,444
He's recovering well.

1428
02:11:49,527 --> 02:11:52,697
Then he should return soon.

1429
02:11:54,616 --> 02:12:00,204
With guaranteed peace,
I think he'll recover sooner.

1430
02:12:07,295 --> 02:12:08,880
May I help you?

1431
02:12:09,005 --> 02:12:11,466
You have a guest
from South Korea.

1432
02:12:14,928 --> 02:12:17,513
How do you do?

1433
02:12:21,100 --> 02:12:23,061
Are you moving away?

1434
02:12:23,811 --> 02:12:28,107
Yes, we are being sent to
the embassy in Cuba.

1435
02:12:33,112 --> 02:12:34,614
You must be In-young.

1436
02:12:38,076 --> 02:12:39,827
Greet him, In-young.

1437
02:12:45,041 --> 02:12:46,626
Hello, sir.

1438
02:12:59,389 --> 02:13:02,642
I'm your daddy's friend.

1439
02:13:03,935 --> 02:13:05,353
We have the same name.

1440
02:13:06,229 --> 02:13:07,229
Cheol-woo.

1441
02:13:07,563 --> 02:13:09,899
I'm KWAK Cheol-woo.

1442
02:13:11,901 --> 02:13:13,027
Here.

1443
02:13:13,111 --> 02:13:16,072
These are for you and your mom.

1444
02:13:17,240 --> 02:13:18,491
Daddy sent them.

1445
02:13:18,950 --> 02:13:19,993
My daddy did?

1446
02:13:23,997 --> 02:13:26,958
Yes, he did.

1447
02:13:41,139 --> 02:13:44,809
I'm JUNG Se-Yong,
Minister of Unification.

1448
02:13:44,892 --> 02:13:47,103
I'm Premier PARK Ki-hyun.

1449
02:13:56,904 --> 02:13:58,364
Guaranteed peace?

1450
02:13:58,865 --> 02:14:00,575
How can we ensure that?

1451
02:14:01,951 --> 02:14:05,621
Give us half of
your nuclear weapons.

1452
02:14:07,498 --> 02:14:12,754
It'll guarantee the end of
both Koreas if we go to war.

1453
02:14:13,713 --> 02:14:18,176
To avoid that,
let's start on a new era of peace.

1454
02:14:24,766 --> 02:14:26,684
We got them, sir.

1455
02:14:28,603 --> 02:14:29,729
Repatriate him.
